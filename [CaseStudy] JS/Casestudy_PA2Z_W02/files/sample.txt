FADE IN:

JUNE 11, 1970S  QUEENS, NEW YORK. THE SUITE - NIGHT

A smoky, overdecorated cocktail lounge and nightclub on 
Queens Boulevard. Sergio Franchi is in full voice on the 
jukebox.  It is after midnight.  It has bean a long night.. 
Balloons and empty glasses litter the place.  BILLY BATTS, 
a 50-year-old hood in an out-of-date suit, court at the 
bar. WE SEE a younger, more sharply-dressed HOOD walk in 
with a BEEHIVE GIRLFRIEND and hug BATTS.

HOOD
Billy. You look beautiful. Welcome 
home.

BAITS
(laughing and turning 
to the bartender)
What are you having? Give 'em what 
they're drinking.

WE SEE FOUR OTHER MEN, including HENRY HILL and JIMMY BURKE, 
standing near BILLY BATTS at the bar, raise their glasses 
in salute. TOMMY DESIMONE and ANOTHER BEEHIVE BLONDE enter. 
BILLY BATTS looks up and sees TOMMY.

BILLY
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew 
up.

TOMMY
(preening a little)
Billy, how are you?

BILLY
(smiling broadly at 
Tommy and the girl)
Son of a bitch. Get over here.

TOMMY walks over and BILLY, too aggressively, grabs TOMMY 
around the neck.  TOMMY doesn't like it.

TOMMY
(forcing a laugh)
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

BILLY
(squeezing Tommy's 
cheek, a little 
too hard)
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," 
he says.  A little pisser I've 
known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, 
don't go get too big.

TOMMY
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

BILLY
(laughing, to the 
crowd at the bar)
Busting his balls?
(to Tommy)
If I was busting your balls, I'd 
send you home for your shine box.

TOMMY'S smile turns to a glare as he realizes BILLY is 
making fun of him. The Men at the bar are roaring with 
laughter.  His GIRL is looking glumly at her shoes.

BILLY
(to the hoods at 
the bar)
You remember Tommy's shines? The 
kid was great.  He made mirrors.

TOMMY
(almost a threat)
No more shines, Billy.

BILLY
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only 
kidding. You can't take a joke? 
Come ooonn.

WE SEE that TOMMY is still angry, but begins to relax with 
BILLY'S apparent apology, but as soon as BILLY sees that 
TOMMY is beginning to relax, he contemptuously turns his 
back on TOMMY.

BILLY
(facing the bar)
Now get the hell home and get your 
shine box.

HENRY quickly steps in front of TOMMY who is about to 
explode. BATTS is facing the bar and does not see just how 
furious TOMMY has become.

HENRY
(gently wrestling 
Tommy away from 
the bar)
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's 
been locked up for six years.

TOMMY
I don't give a shit. That guy's 
got no right.

HENRY
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. 
Forget about it.

TOMMY
(trying to wrestle 
past Henry)
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. 
He's never been any fuckin' good.

HENRY
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.

TOMMY
(to Henry)
Keep him here. I'm going for a 
bag.

TOMMY roughly grabs his GIRL'S arm and storms out.

HENRY
(rejoining Jimmy 
and Billy Batts at 
the bar)
Batts. I'm sorry.  Tommy gets 
loaded.  He doesn't mean any 
disrespect.

BATTS
He's got a hot head.

WE SEE the LAST TWO GUESTS get up to leave. HENRY puts 
another dollar in the jukebox and moves back behind the 
bar and starts to total the register receipts.

CUT TO:

From HENRY'S POV behind the bar, WE SEE the GUESTS leave 
and suddenly WE SEE TOMMY in the doorway. HENRY walks around 
the bar and approaches TOMMY.

WE SEE JIMMY and BATTS are still seated at bar with their 
backs to the door.

BATTS
They're fucking mutts.

WE SEE JIMMY nod.

BUTTS
I seen them.    They walk around 
like big shots and they don't know 
shit.

JIMMY
A guy gets half a load on.  He 
mouths off.

BATTS
When I was a kid, I swear on my 
mother, you mouth off, you got 
your fucking legs broke.

CUT TO:

HENRY

Approaching TOMMY who is carrying a large folded package 
under one arm.

TOMMY, followed by HENRY, walks over to the bar where JIMMY 
and BILLY BATTS are talking. TOMMY drops the package on 
the floor.

BILLY BATTS looks up.

JIMMY turns around and sees that TOMMY has a gun in his 
hand.

JIMMY immediately grabs BATTS's arms and WE SEE TOMMY smash 
the gun into the side of BATTS's head. WE SEE TOMMY hit 
BATTS again and again as JIMMY continues to hold BATTS's 
arms.

JIMMY
(to Henry, while 
pinning Batts's 
arms)
Quick! Lock the door.

WE SEE TOMMY club BATTS to the ground with JIMMY holding 
BATTS's arms.

CUT TO:

HENRY locking the door.

CUT TO:

BATTS'S INERT FORM  -

on the floor.

WE SEE TOMMY unfold the package he had dropped near the 
bar.

It is a plastic, flower-printed mattress cover.

TOMMY and JIMMY start putting BAITS's legs into the mattress 
cover.

HENRY is standing over them as JIMMY and TOMMY struggle to 
fit BAITS' s body into the mattress cover.

HENRY
What are we going to do with him? 
We can't dump him in the street.

JIMMY
(to Henry)
Bring the car round back. I know a 
place Upstate they'll never find 
him.

TOMMY is looking brightly at HENRY, as he and JIMMY finally 
zip BATTS in the mattress cover.

TOMMY
I didn't want to get blood on your 
floor.

EXT. REAR DRIVEWAY - THE SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness. The open trunk of HENRY 's car. The mattress 
cover is being shoved into the trunk by the THREE MEN.  It 
is heavy work.

HENRY
Batts's made. His whole crew is 
going to be looking for him. This 
is fucking bad.

TOMMY
There's a shovel at my mother's.

INT. TOMMY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Darkness in the kitchen. We hear noise of doors opening 
and tools being banged around in the dark.

TOMMY
SSHHH. You'll wake 'er up.

Suddenly the light in the entryway goes on, and WE SEE 
TOMMY'S MOTHER, in housecoat, beaming at her SON and his 
FRIENDS.

CUT TO:

where TOMMY'S MOTHER' hovers over the seated TOMMY, HENRY 
and JIMMY. The table is filled with plates and coffee cops 
and the debris of dirty dishes.

MOTHER
(to all)
Have some more. Yon hardly touched 
anything. Did Tommy tell you about 
my painting? Look.

WE SEE her reach next to the refrigerator and pull up a 
couple of oil paintings she props on the edge of the table.

MOTHER (CONTD)
(proudly)
They want me to do a portrait next. 
I'm gonna do the Moan Lisa.

CUT TO:

WINDOW

where WE SEE HENRY 's car with the body in the trunk, still 
parked at the curb.

INT. HENRY'S CAR - NIGHT

Finally on their way, HENRY is driving. JIMMY, in the 
passenger's seat, and TOMMY, in the rear seat, embracing 
the shovel, are dozing off. The sleepy humming of the wheels 
is suddenly interrupted by a thumping sound. At first, 
HENRY thinks he has a flat, but the thumping is too 
irregular. JIMMY awakens. His eyes are on HENRY. TOMMY 
leans forward from the rear seat. Silence.  Thump Silence.

EXT. MERRITT PARKWAY - NIGHT

Car pulls off the road onto the grass. HENRY, JIMMY and 
TOMMY, still holding the shovel, get out of the car.

TOMMY
Jesus Christ! Miserable bastard!

HENRY opens the trunk and steps back.  In the trunk light 
WE SEE the mattress cover squirming around. We hear muffled 
groans.

TOMMY
(raising the shovel)
Can you believe this no-good fuck? 
The prick! He's still alive.

TOMMY suddenly smashes the shovel into the moving, bloody 
mattress cover.  He smashes it again and again and again. 
Cursing BATTS with every swing.

TOMMY
Rat bastard.
(he swings shovel)
No-good, low-life fuck.

TOMMY swings shovel again and again.

Soon the mattress cover stops squirming and TOMMY stops 
swinging the shovel. He is exhausted. TOMMY and JIMMY get 
back in the car.  HENRY is facing the open trunk.

TILT UP and FREEZE ON HENRY'S face slamming the trunk shut.

HENRY (V.O.)
As far back as I can remember, I 
always wanted to be a gangster.

MAIN TITLE:

GOOD FELLAS

UNFREEZE and

DISSOLVE TO:

HENRY - AS A CHILD

looking out his bedroom window.

TITLE - EAST NEW YORK:  BROOKLYN.  1955.

HENRY (V.O.)
To me, being a gangster was better 
than being President of the United 
States.

EXT.  CABSTAND - NIGHT

HENRY'S POV - A GRIMY ONE-STORY CABSTAND

with faded "Pitkin Avenue Cabs" sign above the door.  Its 
after midnight.  WE SEE A HALF-DOZEN, immaculately-dressed

HOODS wearing diamond pinky rings and silk shirts, lounging 
around the cabstand talking and sipping coffee.

HENRY (V.O.)
Even before I first wandered into 
the cabstand for an after-school 
job, I knew I wanted to be a part 
of them. It was there I belonged.

HENRY'S POV

WE SEE a Cadillac pull up to the cabstand.  WEE SEE the 
car rise slightly when TWO huge, dapper HOODS get out.

On HOOD #1 WE SEE large diamond pinky ring on a sausage-
thick finger.

On HOOD #2 WE SEE a broken-nosed hood's tie hanging loosely 
across his monogrammed shirt like a silk bandolier.

HENRY (V.O.)
To me it meant being somebody in a 
neighborhood full of nobodies.

On the sidewalk WE SEE the TWO HOODS who just got out of 
the car hug and playfully shove TUDDY VARIO, the sloppily-
dressed, solidly-built HOOD who runs the cabstand.

HENRY (V.O.)
They weren't like anyone else. 
They did whatever they wanted. 
They'd double-park in front of the 
hydrant and nobody ever gave them 
a ticket.  In the summer when they 
played cards all night, nobody 
ever called the cops.

WE SEE TODDY laughingly try to push them away.

HENRY (V.O.)
Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a 
pizzeria and a few other places 
for his brother, Paul, who was the 
boss over everybody in the 
neighborhood.

WE SEE a laughing HOOD #1 slyly slip behind TUDDY and grab 
him around the neck, while HOOD #2 starts feigning punches 
to TODDY's ample midsection.

Suddenly TODDY VARIO and HOODS see that PAUL VARIO, the 
boss, is standing in the cabstand's doorway. VARIO is

A large man, standing six-feet tall and weighing over 240 
pounds. He appears even larger.

HENRY (V.O.)
Paulie might have moved slow, but 
it was only because he didn't have 
to move for anybody.

TODDY and HOODS immediately stop horsing around.

TITLES CONTINUE.

CHILD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CARMELLA HILL, HENRY'S mother, shoves his books under his 
arm and pushes him into the hallway. WE SEE. HENRY'S TWO 
BROTHERS putting on their jackets and picking up their 
books and almost tripping over another brother's, MICHAEL, 
wheelchair.  WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF TWO SISTERS eating 
breakfast.

WE SEE HENRY'S construction worker FATHER sipping coffee 
in kitchen before going to work.

HENRY (V.O.)
At first, my parents loved that I 
found a job across the street. My 
father, who was Irish, was sent to 
work at the age of eleven, and he 
liked that I got myself a job. He 
always said American kids were 
spoiled lazy.

CARMELLA
(to the brood)
Come on. Come on. You'll all be 
late.

HENRY (V.O.)
And my mother was happy after she 
found out that the Varios came 
from the same part of Sicily as 
she did. To my mother, it was the 
answer to her prayers.

WE SEE HENRY'S MOTHER shove him out the door with his school 
books.

EXT. STREET SIDE OF DOOR - DAY

CARMELLA, in doorway, watches HENRY go down the block toward 
school. When HENRY turns the corner, along with

OTHER school-bound' YOUNGSTERS, WE SEE he suddenly stops. 
The OTHER SCHOOLCHILDREN keep walking.  HENRY carefully 
sticks his head around the corner. His MOTHER is no longer 
there.

WE SEE HENRY race across the street toward the cabstand.

HENRY (V.O.)
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

EXT. CABSTAND - DAY

WE SEE HENRY leap into the air to catch a set of car keys.

HENRY (V.O.)
I could go anywhere.

EXT. CABSTAND PARKING LOT - DAY

WE SEE HENRY, who can hardly see over the dashboard, 
jockeying a MOBSTER'S Caddy around the cabstand parking 
lot. WE SEE OTHER KIDS, HENRY'S age, watching HENRY, in 
awe, from behind a fence.

HENRY (V.O.)
I could do anything.

INT. CABSTAND BACKROOM - DAY

WE SEE HENRY watching TWO UNIFORMED COPS laughing with 
TODDY and SOME HOODS while stuffing whisky bottles under 
their tunics.

HENRY
I knew everybody and everybody 
knew me.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE CABSTAND - DAY

WE SEE HENRY trying to sip hot espresso coffee just like 
the BIG GUYS, except WE SEE HENRY grimace because the coffee 
is too hot and far too bitter.

HENRY (V.O.)
But it wasn't too long before my 
parents changed their minds. For 
them, the cabstand was supposed to 
be a part-tie job, but  for me,   
it was full-time.

CUT TO:

INT. REAR OF CABSTAND

TODDY is folding and placing long sheets with policy bets 
into a brown paper bag. In the BG, WE SEE HOODS going 
through boxes of stolen orange and blue cardigan sweaters.  
HENRY waits at TUDDY'S side until TODDY finishes making a 
notation on a slip of paper. TODDY holds the paper bag in 
his hands and

TODDY
(to Henry, with a 
smile)
Okay.

EXT. CABSTAND

WE SEE HENRY running out the cabstand door carrying the 
paper bag. He runs past HALF A DOZEN HOODS, lounging outside 
on wooden chairs, wearing orange and blue sweaters.

HENRY
People like my father could never 
understand, but I was a part of 
something. I belonged.  I was 
treated like a grown-up. Every day 
I was learning to score.

INT. KITCHEN - HENRY'S HOUSE

FATHER
(in mock concern)
Did you study hard in school today? 
Did you learn a lot? Huh?

HENRY is silent and begins backing away.

FATHER
I can't hear you, you little liar.
(waving the letter)
I got this from the school. They 
say you haven't been there in 
months.

HENRY tries to dart past his FATHER, but he cannot escape.  
HENRY gets a blow on the back of his head. HENRY'S MOTHER 
starts to interfere, but is pushed back.

FATHER
(beating Henry, but 
glaring at Carmella)
Little lying bastard.

CARMELLA screams.  HENRY doubles up.  HENRY'S FATHER keeps 
pounding away.

CLOSE ON HENRY'S FACE

FREEZE IN ACTION ON HENRY'S FATHER'S FACE

HENRY (V.O.)
My father was always pissed off.  
He was pissed that he had to work 
so hard. He was pissed that he 
made such lousy money. Be was pissed 
that there were seven of us living 
in a tiny house. But after a while, 
he was mostly pissed that I hung 
around the cabstand. He said they 
were bums and that I was a bum.  
He said I was going to get into 
trouble.  I used to say I was only 
running errands after school, but 
he knew better.  He knew what went 
on at the cabstand and, every once 
in a while, usually after he got 
his load on, I had to take a 
beating. But by then, I didn't 
care. No matter how many beatings 
I took, I wouldn't listen to what 
he said.  I don't think I even 
heard him. The way I saw it, 
everybody has to take a beating 
some time.

UNFREEZE and continue the beating.

CUT TO:

HENRY'S SWOLLEN AND BEATEN FACE

INT. CABSTAND BACKROOM

TODDY
What happened to you?

HENRY
I can't make any more deliveries.

TODDY
Whadda you mean, you can't make 
any more deliveries? You're going 
to fuck up everything?

HENRY
My father got a letter from the 
school. He said the next time he'll 
kill me.

CUT TO:

INT. AUTOMOBILE

THREE HOODS and HENRY in parked car outside the post office.

HOOD #1
(pointing to one 
postman)
Is that the one?

HENRY
NO.

HOOD »2
(pointing at another)
Him?

HENRY
No.
(pause)
There. That's him. That's the guy.

HOOD #1 and HOOD #2 get out of the car and grab the stunned 
MAILMAN. He loses his hat and spills some mail as they 
shove him into the car's rear seat.

INT. A NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZERIA

TODDY VARIO is standing in front of a pizza oven. HENRY 
watches the HOODS shove the MAILMAN against the side of 
the oven. WE SEE PAUL VARIO in the BG.

TODDY
(pointing to Henry)
You know this kid?

MAILMAN
(barely able to 
speak)
Yes.

TUDDY
You know where he lives?

MAILMAN nods.

TODDY
You deliver mail to his house?

MAILMAN nods again.

TODDY
From now on, any letters to the 
kid from his school come directly 
here. Do you understand? One more 
letter from the school to the kid's 
house and ...

TODDY looks at PAUL VARIO, who nods, and the HOODS pull 
down the door or the pizza oven and shove the MAILMAN up 
close.

TODDY
... you're going in the oven head-
first.

FREEZE ON MAILMAN'S face, smeared against the hot stove.

RENKY (V.O.)
That was it. No more letters from 
truant officers. No more letters 
from school. In fact, no more 
letters from anybody. How could I 
go back to school after that and 
pledge allegiance to the flag and 
sit through good government 
bullshit.

EXT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

WE SEE HENRY entering a mob social club, nodding to a 
friendly COP lounging outside, past WISEGUYS in sleeveless 
underwear sunning themselves in front of the club. WE SEE 
A COUPLE OF MENACING HOODS smile and nod hello at HENRY.

REAR YARD OF SOCIAL CLUB

HOODS are cooking sausages and peppers on grill. There are 
bottles of homemade wine and keg of beer.

WE SEE PAUL VAHIO holding court while eating a sausage 
sandwich.  There are HOODS standing around him at a 
respectful distance. Only TODDY approaches him with ease.

WE SEE A HOOD talk to TODDY.  WE SEE TODDY relay the message 
to PAUL. WE SEE PAUL say something to TODDY, who nods back 
to the HOOD and then motions to HENRY to come over.  WE 
SEE TODDY bend down a little and whisper in HENRY's ear.

DOLLY IN ON PAUL's face.

HENRY (V.O.)
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie 
and he got a piece of everything 
they made. It was tribute, just 
like the old country, except they 
were doing it in America.  All 
they got from Paulie was protection 
from other guys looking to rip 
them off. That's what it's all 
about. That's what the FBI can 
never understand -- that what Paulie 
and the organization does is offer 
protection for people who can't go 
to the cops. They're like the police 
department for wiseguys.

EXT. USED CAR LOT - NIGHT

WE SEE TUDDY in his car, hand HENRY a hammer, some rags, - 
and a five-gallon can of gasoline.

TODDY
(driving away)
I'll be up at the corner.

WE SEE HENRY break the windows of about six cars parked 
facing the sidewalk.

HENRY (V.O.)
People locked at me differently. 
They knew I was with somebody.

HE SEE HENRY shove the gas-soaked rags through the broken 
car windows.  HENRY looks up the block where TODDY has 
parked. HE SEE TODDY (from HENRY'S LOT) look around and 
nod. HENRY immediately begins tossing lighted matchbooks 
through the smashed car windows.

HENRY (V.O.)
I didn't have to wait on line at 
the bakery on Sunday morning anymore 
for fresh bread. The owner knew 
who I was with, and he'd come from 
around the counter, no matter how 
many people were waiting.  I was 
taken care of first.

Suddenly the night explodes in orange brightness. WE SEE 
HENRY begin to run toward TUDDY"s car as the cars he has 
ignited begin to explode behind him.

HENRY (V.O.)
Our neighbors didn't park in our 
driveway anymore, even though we 
didn't have a car. At thirteen, I 
was making more money than most of 
the grownups in the neighborhood.  
I had more money than I could spend. 
I had it all.

FREEZE ON HENRY'S a silhouette against the darkness like a 
man in hell.

HENRY (V.O.)
One day some of the kids from the 
neighborhood carried my mother's 
groceries all the way home for 
her. It was out of respect.

CUT TO:

EXT.  HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

HENRY'S MOTHER opens door of house, bright daylight.

MOTHER'S POV

She sees grey lizard shoes, grey pinstriped trousers, grey 
silk shirt, Billy Eckstein collar, yellow silk tie, and 
double-breasted jacket.  She looks up and sees HENRY'S 
smiling face.

MOTHER
(aghast)
My God!  You look like a gangster.

CUT TO:

SCREAMING MAN

Running toward the pizzeria, holding his hand.

EXT.:  PIZZERIA - DAY

WE SEE HENRY standing near front of store.

MAN
(screaming)
I've been shot! Help!  Help!

TUDDY
(from rear of store, 
to Henry)
Close the door. Don't let him in.

HENRY grabs a chair, takes it outside for the MAN to sit 
on and closes the pizzeria door.

The MAS collapses in the seat and HENRY immediately starts 
wrapping the MAN'S shredded and bleeding hand in his apron. 
The MAN is turning white and praying.

HENRY
(soothing the man)
It's okay. It's okay. They're 
getting an ambulance.

WE SEE HENRY prop the MAN in his chair and race into the 
pizzeria for more aprons which he takes outside and wraps 
around the MAN'S bleeding hand, just as an ambulance pulls 
up.

WE SEE TODDY come up behind HENRY as the MAN is rushed 
away.

HENRY (V.O.)
It was the first time I had ever 
seen anyone shot.

TODDY
(angry)
You're some fucking jerk.

WE SEE that HENRY is stunned.

TODDY
I You wasted eight fucking aprons 
on that guy. :

HENRY (V.O.)
I remember feeling bad about the 
guy. But I remember feeling that 
maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew 
Paulie didn't want anybody dying 
in the building.

CUT TO:

INT.  CABSTAND - NIGHT

HENRY is making a ham and cheese sandwich.

CAMERA TRACKING through room full of PEOPLE playing cards, 
through professional CARD DEALERS skittering cards across 
green felt tables, through BODYGUARDS watching the door, 
through TUDDY VARIO walking around the tables, through 
PAUL VARIO standing quietly on the side, through HENRY 
giving the sandwich to ONE of the PLAYERS.

HENRY (V.O.)
It was a glorious time. Wiseguys 
were all over the place. It was 
before Apalachin and before Crazy 
Joey decided to take on a boss and 
start a war. It was when I met the 
world.  It was when I first met 
Jimmy Burke.

CAMERA COMES TO REST when JIMMY BROKE walks in the door.

CUT TO:

HENRY

Looking at JIMMY

HENRY (V.O.)
He couldn't have been more than 
twenty-four or twenty-five at the 
time, but he was already a legend. 
He'd walk in the door and everybody 
who worked the room went wild. 
He'd give the doorman a hundred 
just for opening the door.  He 
shoved hundreds in the pockets of 
the dealers and who ran the games. 
The bartender got a hundred just 
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

HENRY sees VARIO give BURKE a hug around the shoulder. 
HENRY sees JIMMY handing money to the DOORMAN.  HENRY 
watches PLAYERS timidly move their chairs slightly to make 
room for JIMMY. HENRY sees JIMMY pull out a wad of bills 
and sit down.

JIMMY
(to Henry, who is 
standing near the 
bar)
Hey, kid! Get me a seven and seven.

WE SEE HENRY make the drink and bring it to JIMMY.

VARIO is standing next to JIMMY.

VARIO
(his arm around 
Henry's shoulder)
Henry. Say hello to Jimmy Burke.

WE SEE JIMMY slip a $20 bill in Henry's shirt pocket.

JIMMY
(lifting his drink 
to Henry)
Keep 'em coming.

FREEZE FRAME OH JIMMY.

HENRY (V.O.)
Jimmy was one of the most feared 
gays in the city.  He was first 
locked up at eleven and was doing 
hits for mob bosses when he was 
sixteen. Hits never bothered him. 
It was business. But what he really 
loved to do was steal.  I mean, he 
actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was 
the kind of guy who rooted for the 
bad guys in the movies.  He was 
one of the city's biggest hijackers. 
Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. 
Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. 
Shrimp and lobsters were the best. 
They went fast.

EXT. TRAILER TRUCK - NEAR IDLEWILD AIRPORT - NIGHT

The trailer truck is stopped at a light in a deserted area 
near JFK Airport. WE SEE the DRIVER being quietly led to a 
car where JIMMY BURKE is standing. WE SEE JIMMY routinely 
take the DRIVER'S wallet. There is absolutely no resistance.

HENRY (V.O.)
And almost all of them were 
gimmie's.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - WALLET

WE SEE JIMMY put a $50 bill in the DRIVER'S wallet.

HENRY
They called him Jimmy the Gent. 
The drivers loved him. They used 
to tip him off about the really 
good loads. Of course, everybody 
got a piece. And when the cops 
assigned a whole army to stop him,
(pause)
Jimmy made them partners.

CUT TO:

EXT.  CABSTAND PACKING LOT - DAY

CLOSE UP - ROWS OF CIGARETTE CARTONS

piled inside a large trailer truck.

JIMMY and TOMMY DESIMONE, a youngster about HENRY's age, 
are moving large cigarette cartons toward truck tailgate. 
While JIMMY is dressed like a truck driver, TOMMY is - 
very nattily dressed in a sharply-cut suit and highly buffed 
shoes.

JIMMY and TOMMY are loading the cartons into the arms of a 
WOMAN SCHOOL-CROSSING GUARD who is having difficulty 
carrying the load.

JIMMY
Tommy. Help the lady.

WE SEE TOMMY scramble down from the truck and help the 
SCHOOL-CROSSING GUARD to her own car where WE SEE she 
already bad a load of the cartons.

WE SEE HENRY standing near her car and watching.

SCHOOL-CROSSING GUARD
(driving off)
Thank you, sweetheart.

CUT TO:

JIMMY standing between TOMMY and HENRY.

JIMMY
(to Henry)
Say hello to Tommy. You'll do good 
together.

CUT TO:

POLICE CAR

pulling onto the sidewalk where HENRY, TOMMY and JIMMY are 
standing. The COPS recognize JIMMY.

COP #1
Anything good?

HENRY watches JIMMY smile and toss a couple of cartons of 
cigarettes into their radio car.

The COPS wave and drive off.

EXT. FACTORY GATE - QUITTING TIME

WE SEE HENRY busily selling cartons to WORKERS. TOMMY is 
getting cartons out. of the trunk of a car parked nearby. 
HENRY is so busy he can hardly keep the money and cash 
straight. Instead of the neat roll we saw on JIMMY, HENRY's 
cash is a wrinkled mess. Some of it is rolled, some folded, 
some in different pockets. WE SEE HENRY approached by TWO 
CITY DETECTIVES.

DETECTIVE #1
What do you think you're doing?

DETECTIVE #2
Where did you get these cigarettes?
(offering them 
cartons)
It's okay.

DETECTIVE #l roughly grabs HENRY's arm.  DETECTIVE #2 grabs 
HENRY's cigarette cartons. WE SEE HENRY pull his arm away 
and ONE of the DETECTIVES slaps him across the face.

WE SEE that TOMMY is about to say something, but runs away 
instead.

INT.  CABSTAND - DAY

WE SEE TOMMY talking to TUDDY and ASSORTED HOODS at the 
cabstand.

INT.  COURTROOM - "AR-1"  (ARRAIGNMENT PART 1)

HENRY is waiting along with DOZENS OF HOOKERS, nodding 
JUNKIES, MUGGERS and SHOPLIFTERS.  When HENRY'S case is 
called, WE PAN to a well-dressed MOB LAWYER.  HENRY, who 
has never seen the LAWYER before, walks to the

PROSECUTOR'S, rather than the DEFENDANT'S table.  A COURT 
CLERK nods him over toward his own LAWYER.

Without acknowledging HENRY, the LAWYER nods and smiles at 
the JUDGE, who smiles and nods back.

JUDGE
Councilor, proceed.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - CENTER AISLE

HENRY is walking out of the court. HENRY sees JIMMY BURKE 
smiling and waiting for him in the rear of the courtroom. 
JIMMY puts his arm around HENRY like a father, and tacks a 
one-hundred dollar bill into HENRY's chest pocket. They 
walk out into the court corridor in silence together and 
then, suddenly, HENRY sees PAUL VARIO, TOMMY, TUDDY, and 
the WHOLE CREW from the cabstand waiting for him. They 
start clapping and whistling and slapping his back and 
cheering. VARIO, TUDDY and BURKE embrace him.

While bewildered COPS and LAWYERS watch!

CHORDS OF HOODS
You broke your cherry! You broke 
your cherry!

LAST FREEZE.

TITLE UP - IDLEWILD AIRPORT:  1955

EXT. WIDE SHOT - IDLEWILD CARGO AREA

HENRY (V.O.)
By the time I grew up, there was 
thirty billion a year in cargo 
moving through Idlewild Airport 
and we tried to steal every bit of 
it.

EXT.  AIRPORT DINER - PARKING LOT - DAY

ANGLE - GREY LIZARD SHOES AND SHARP GREY PANTS

and UP TO SEE HENRY standing in parking lot, when a large 
truck pulls up. WE SEE TOMMY DESIMONE standing with him.

HENRY (V.O.)
You've got to understand, we grew 
up near the airport.. It belonged 
to Paulie. We had friends and 
relatives who worked all over the 
place and they tipped as off about 
what was coming in and what was 
going out.

WE SEE DRIVES get out of track with engine still running 
and leave door open. He nods to HENRY who does not respond 
and the DRIVES casually walks toward the diner.

HENRY (V.O.)
If any of the truckers or airlines 
gave as trouble, Paulie had his 
people scare then with a little 
strike. It was beautiful. It was 
an even bigger money-major than 
numbers, and Jimmy was in charge. 
Whenever we needed money, we'd rob 
the airport. To us, it was better 
than Citibank.

INT. TABLE IN DINER

WE SEE DRIVER rise from debris of breakfast dishes, leave 
a tip and pay the CASHIER. Be walks out the door toward 
his truck in the parking lot.

HOLD ON the door.

DRIVER rushes back in through the door toward the CASHIER.

DRIVER
(flushed and agitated)
Hurry, gimme the phone. Two niggers 
just stole my track.

INT. SONNY'S BAMBOO LOUNGE - DUSK

A cavernous room within earshot of the airport that looks 
like a movie nightclub. No matter when you walk into the 
Bamboo Lounge it's always the middle of the night.

CAMERA TRACKS past the zebra-striped banquettes and bar 
stools, past sharpy BUSINESSMEN, BOOKMAKERS and HOODS.

HENRY (V.O.)
There was Jimmy and Tommy and me. 
And there was Anthony Stabile, 
Angelo Sepe, Fat Andy, Frankie the 
Wop, Freddy No Nose, Pete the 
Killer, Nicky Blanda, Mikey 
Franzese, and Johnny Echoes, who 
got that nickname because he said 
everything twice.  Like*, "You 
wanna get the papers, get the 
papers."

CAMERA TRACKS to the backroom which WE SEE is filled with 
racks of clothes, boxed television sets, new toaster ovens 
and stereos.  WE SEE MAN rolling racks of fur coats into 
the room which looks like a discount store warehouse.

MAN
(to Sonny)
Sonny, we got the coats.

SONNY
(ignoring the man, 
and to Henry)
You got any suits?

HENRY
Not till Thursday.

SONNY
(closing door to 
backroom)
I need suits.

CUT TO:

HENRY, JIMMY, TOMMY, AND ASSORTED HOODS AND THEIR 
GIRLFRIENDS

are having a party. There are champagne buckets around the 
table which is littered with steak and lobster dishes. The 
table is a mess and everyone is laughing. WE SEE HENRY 
look at his watch and look at the lounge's entrance.

HENRY (V.O.)
For us to live any other way was 
nuts. To us, those goody-good people 
who worked shitty jobs for bum 
paychecks, who took the subway to 
work every day and worried about 
their bills, were dead. They were 
suckers. They had no balls. If we 
wanted something, we just took it. 
If anyone complained twice, they 
got hit so bad they never complained 
again. It was routine. You didn't 
even think about it.

CUT TO:

DOORWAY or BAMBOO LOUNGE WE SEE FRENCHY MCMAHON, a beefy 
man in a leather wind-breaker, enter.

WE SEE HENRY get up and go over to greet him.

CUT TO:

THE BAR

HENRY and FRENCHY embrace.

FRENCHY is still wearing his Air France cargo worker's - 
coveralls under his leather jacket and WE SEE the "Air 
France" logo and the name "Frenchy" in script over the 
coverall's breast pocket.

FRENCHY
(trying to whisper 
above the din)
It's all there. I can get you past 
the alarms and I can get the key.

WE SEE HENRY torn to table and wave at JIMMY to join the 
at the bar.

CUT TO:

THE TABLE

WE SEE JIMMY get up and go to the bar.

WE SEE TOMMY at the table with SONNY BAMBOO, the owner, 
hovering around. SONNY BAMBOO is holding a thick sheaf of 
bills.  WE SEE SONNY timidly approach TOMMY by whispering 
in his ear. In the BG, WE ALSO SEE the face of a terrified 
WAITER.

TOMMY
(putting his arm 
around Sonny's 
shoulder)
It's okay.  Put it on the tab.

SONNY
(whispering with 
fear a11 over his 
face)
Tommy, it's not just this.  Tommy, 
please. It's seven grand here.

WE SEE TOMMY just stare menacingly at SONNY.

SONNY
(he started, he 
might as well finish)
Tommy, I need the money, Tommy, 
please. I owe the world.

TOMMY
(leaping from the 
table in a rage)
You Sonofabitch fuck. Are you 
calling me a deadbeat?  The money 
I spent here? Embarrassing me in 
front of my friends. You miserable 
fuck.
(turning to his 
pals)
Can you believe this bastard?
(back to a terrified 
Sonny)
Ungrateful fuck!  I oughta break 
your fucking legs!

WE SEE SONNY BAMBOO flee toward his office, with TOMMY 
making a half-hearted gesture to follow, but instead, he 
walks over and joins HENRY, JIMMY and FRENCHY at the bar. 
He is smiling.

FRENCHY
(to Tommy)
Hey, Tommy. Have a drink.

INT.  BACKROOM - CABSTAND - DAY

WE SEE SONNY BAMBOO meekly seated at table facing PAUL 
VARIO.  HENRY is standing behind SONNY BAMBOO for support.

VARIO
(groaning)
If you knew those fucking kids. 
They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. 
What am I going to do with them?

SONNY
(sweating)
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all 
kinds of things. Paulie.  You know 
me all my life.  I've always done 
the right thing.

VARIO
You think that matters?  You think 
they give a shit about anything? 
The little bastards.

SONNY
But it isn't right, Paulie.    
That Tommy, he's making trouble 
for me all over town.  I can't go 
here.  I can't go there.

VARIO
You?  You think you're the only 
one?  I've talked to them a million 
times, but they don't listen.

SONNY
(weakly)
But, Paulie, please.

VARIO
(barely listening)
Someday they'll get what's coming 
to them. That's the only way they'll 
stop.

SONNY
(pleading)
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The 
guy's nuts. What do I have to do? 
Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.

VARIO
(arms outstretched 
like a saint)
What can I do? If I could do 
something, don't you think I would?

SONNY looks up at HENRY for support.

HENRY
(to Sonny)
Tell him. It's okay.

VARIO
What?

SONNY
I was thinking that maybe you could 
come in with me. Take a piece of 
the place. If you were with me, 
maybe than they'd have to lay off.

VASIO
What, do I need ...

SONNY
(interrupting)
I mean it. We could do good.

VARIO
You want a partner?

SONNY
Please?

EXT. BAMBOO LOUNGE - OUTSIDE - DAY

WE SEE trucks with liquor, beer, sides of beef, even 
furniture like bar stools and large mirrors being unloaded 
and delivered into the front door.

HENRY (V.O.)
Now the guy's got Paulie for a 
partner. Any problems, he goes to 
Paulie. Trouble with the bill?  He 
can go to Paulie. Trouble with the 
cops? Deliveries? Tommy? He can 
call Paulie.

INT.  BAMBOO LOUNGE - DAY

WE SEE HENRY AND TWO HOODS from cabstand checking the cases 
of liquor being delivered into the lounge. The entire room 
is filled floor to ceiling with cases of whiskey, wine, 
crates of lobster, and shrimp, and stacks of table linen 
and sides of beef. The place looks like a warehouse.

HENRY (V.O.)
But now the guy has got to come up 
with Paulie 's money every week, 
no matter what. Business bad? Fuck 
you, pay me. You had a fire?  Fuck 
you, pay ma.  The place got hit by 
lighting? Fuck you, pay me.  Also, 
Paulie could do anything. Especially 
run up bills on the joint's credit. 
Why not? Nobody's gonna pay for it 
anyway.

EXT.  BAMBOO LOUNGE - REAR ALLEYWAY - DAY

WE SEE cases of liquor, wine, etc., being carried out of 
the rear door of the lounge by HOODS from the cabstand and 
loaded onto U-Haul trucks.

HENRY (V.O.)
As soon as the deliveries are made 
in the front door, you move the 
stuff out the back and sell it at 
a discount. You take a two hundred 
dollar case of booze and sell it 
for a hundred. It doesn't matter. 
It's all profit.

INT.  BAMBOO LOUNGE OFFICE

HENRY, JIMMY and TOMMY are standing around the small 
workman's table. There is no desk. The office looks denuded 
of furniture.  A LAWYER is going over papers.

A terrified, unshaven SONNY BAMBOO is seated behind the 
desk. The LAWYER is showing him where to sign.

HENRY (V.O.)
And, finally, when there's nothing 
1 left, when you can't borrow 
another buck from the bank or buy 
another case of booze, you bust 
the joint out.

CUT DIRECTLY TO:

LARGE CLOSE UP OF - HANDS

making rolls of toilet paper being kneaded into long rolls 
with Sterno.

CUT TO:

HENRY AND TOMMY shoving wads of Sterno paper into the 
ceiling rafters.

HENRY (V.O.)
You light a match.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - MATCH

Lighting rolls of Sterno paper.

EXT. BAMBOO LOUNGE - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

The street is empty.  HENRY and TOMMY are seated in HENRY'S 
car. They are watching the Bamboo Lounge.

TOMMY
(to Henry)
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl 
I told you about? Diana? She's 
from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. 
She won't go out with me alone. 
Can you believe this shit? She's 
fucking prejudiced, but she's built. 
She's never been out with an Italian 
before. She says she'll only go 
out on a double date with her 
girlfriend.  You believe this shit? 
But you gotta see her. I mean, 
she's beautiful.

HENRY
(laughing)
Will you get the fuck out of here.

TOMMY
Is it my fault she won't go out 
without her girlfriend?  For 
Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't 
even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's 
the big deal?

HENRY
Tommy  ...

CUT TO:

HENRY AND TOMMY

watching smoke coming out of basement windows of Bamboo 
Lounge.

TOMMY (O.S.)
(back to conversation)
I swear you don't have to do 
nothing. You just show up and then 
leave. What do you think, I want 
you around? All I need is for you 
to get me started.

We hear car angina start.

INT. A QUIET PLUSH BANQUETTE IN THE VILLA CAPRA

A red damask restaurant. TOMMY and HENRY are seated on the 
outside of a U-shaped banquette with their two girls, DIANE 
and KAREN, seated inside.  DIANE is being wooed and pawed 
by a blissful TOMMY. DIANE is enjoying every bit of TOMMY'S 
undivided attention. KAREN has not touched her melted baked 
Alaska and is looking directly at HENRY. HENRY is stirring 
his coffee.

HENRY (V.O.)
I had a meeting with Tuddy around 
eleven o'clock and here I am a 
back-up guy.

KAREN
(sarcastically)
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you 
up.

HENRY (V.O.)
I couldn't wait to get away. I was 
ordering the dessert when they 
were eating dinner. When they were 
having coffee, I was asking for a 
check.

TOMMY
(to Henry, while 
hugging Diana)
Isn't she great? Isn't this great? 
Let's do it tomorrow night? Okay?

KAREN (V.O.)
I couldn't stand him.  I thought 
he was really obnoxious. He kept 
fidgeting around.

EXT. RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

WE SEE HENRY pushing KAREN Into the car.

KAREN (V.O.)
Before it was even time to go home 
he was pushing me into the car ...

EXT. CURBSIDE - KAREN'S HOUSE -

WE SEE HENRY hurrying KAREN out of the car.

KAREN (V.O.)
... and then pulling me out.  It 
was ridiculous. But Diana and Tommy 
had made us promise to meet them 
again on Friday night. We agreed. 
Of course, when Friday night came 
around, Henry stood me up.

INT.  VILLA CAPRA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WE SEE TOMMY, DIANE and KAREN seated at a table set for 
four.

KAREN (V.O.)
We were a trio instead of double-
date that night, but I made Tommy 
take me looking for him.

EXT. CABSTAND SIDEWALK - NIGHT

A hot night. The HOODS have moved to the sidewalk where WE 
SEE them sitting in sleeveless underwear, watching the 
street.

WE SEE HENRY leave the cabstand when suddenly a car 
screeches up on the sidewalk directly in front of him. The 
HOODS scatter and WE SEE that HENRY is terrified.

KAREN
(charging out of 
the door, screaming)
You've got some nerve. Standing me 
up. Nobody does that to me. Who do 
you think you are? A big shot?

CUT TO:

HENRY

who sees TOMMY and DIANE in the car, laughing.

HENRY
(embarrassed and 
defensive)
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought 
it was next week.

KAREN
Liar!

CUT TO:

HENRY

Who sees the WISEGUYS laughing.

HENRY
Take it easy.  We can talk about 
it.

HENRY (V.O.)
She's screaming on the street and 
I mean loud, but she looked good. 
She had these violet eyes.  I 
remember she's screaming, but mostly 
I'm looking at her eyes. They were 
just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's 
what everybody said.

KAREN
(furious)
Talk? To you? After what you did!

HENRY
I thought you were going to stand 
me up. You looked bored. You didn't 
say anything. What did you expect. 
Tommy was all over me. Right?

WE SEE KAREN relax for a second.

HENRY
Come on, let me make it up.

INT.  ENTRY TO KAREN'S SUBURBAN HOME - EVENING

ANGLE ON GOLD CROSS AROUND MAN'S NECK

and TILT UP. HENRY is all smiles and slicked-up.

Standing in the door wearing a grey suit and open-necked 
black silk shirt with a gold cross and chain.

KAREN
(filled with alarm)
Button year shirt, quick!  Hurry

HENRY buttons his shirt as KAREN'S MOTHER comes to the 
door.

KAREN
Ma, this is my friend, Henry Hill.

MOTHER
My daughter says you're half-Jewish?

EXT.  COPACABANA - NIGHT

HENRY gives the keys and a rolled-up twenty-dollar bill to 
the DOORMAN at the building across the street and steers 
KAREN toward the Copa.

KAREN
What're you doing? What about the 
car?

HENRY
(while pushing her 
through the crowd 
waiting to get in)
He watches it for me. It's better 
than waiting at a garage.

HE SEE HENRY deftly steer KAREN away from the Copa's main 
entrance and down the basement steps. A HUGE BODYGUARD, 
eating a sandwich in the stairwell, gives HENRY a big 
"Hello." WE SEE HENRY walk right through the basement 
kitchen, which is filled with CHINESE and LATINO COOKS and 
DISHWASHERS who pay no attention. KAREN is being dragged 
along, open-mouthed, at the scene. HENRY starts up a stained 
kitchen staircase through a pair of swinging doors and 
suddenly KAREN sees she is inside the main room. The harried 
MAITRE D' (he is surrounded by CUSTOMERS clamoring for 
their tables) waves happily at HENRY and signals to a 
CAPTAIN. WE SEE a table held aloft by TWO WAITERS wedging 
their way toward the stage and plant the table smack in 
front of what had until that moment been a ringside table. 
As HENRY leads KAREN to their seat, she sees that he is 
nodding and shaking hands with MANY of the OTHER GUESTS.  
WE SEE HENRY quietly slip twenty-dollar-bills to the 
WAITERS.

KAREN
(sitting down)
You gave them twenty dollars each?

WE SEE the CAPTAIN approach with champagne.

CAPTAIN
This is from Mister Tony, over 
there.

HENRY
Where, over there?

CAPTAIN
Over there, over there.

KAREN watches HENRY turn around and wave at a 280-POUND 
HOOD.

KAREN
What do you do?

HENRY
(toasting Karen and 
clinking glasses)
I'm in construction.

KAREN
(taking his hands)
They don't feel like you're in 
construction.

HENRY turns to the stage where the lights begin to dim and 
BENNY YOUNGMAN walks out.

HENRY
I'm a union delegate.

EXT. AIR FRANCE CARGO AREA - NIGHT

On loading platform HE SEE HENRY and TOMMY dressed in Air 
France coveralls.

HENRY is carrying a large suitcase.

Suddenly WE SEE FRENCHY McMAHON come through a door, slip 
HENRY a key and lead them back into the office area near 
the entrance.

HENRY goes to the door marked "SECURITY AREA" that FRENCHY 
points out and opens it with the key. HENRY and TOMMY go 
inside.

CUT TO:

HENRY AND TOMMY

coming out with the suitcase, close the door and walk right 
past FRENCHY without saying a word.

INT. CABSTAND BACKROOM - NIGHT

WE SEE the suitcase open on the desk. WE SEE VARIO, JIMMY, 
HENRY and TOMMY standing around, wreathed in smiles. HENRY 
is counting stacks of cash, spreading them all over the 
desk.

HENRY (V.O.)
Air France made me. We walked out 
with four hundred and twenty 
thousand dollars without a gun. 
And we did the right thing.

HENRY counts up $420,000 and slides ten packages of $l00-
bills in front of VARIO who stands up and proudly kisses 
HENRY on the cheek. JIMMY and TOMMY, both aglow with the 
moment, look on.  It is clear that HENRY has come of age.

CUT TO:

HENRY'S FACE

VARIO
(to Henry)
It's a lot of money for a kid. If 
anyone asks, just say you won it 
shooting crap.

EXT. BEACH CLUB - DAY

HENRY and KAREN are at a sun-drenched table after paper-
cup and paper-plate lunch where HENRY is trying to pay 
cash.

KAREN
(touching Henry's 
arm)
No.  No.  You've got to sign for 
it.

WE SEE athletic YOUNG MEN and WOMEN in white clothe* 
carrying tennis and squash rackets walk by. One young man, 
BRUCE, says hello to KAREN. She introduces him to HENRY.

CUT TO:

KAREN
(after Bruce walks 
on)
He lives across the street.

CUT TO:

CHAMPAGNE

being sent to table.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS to stage where WE SEE SINGER'S back and HENRY 
and KAREN at a luxurious ringside table with linen, silver, 
and crystal.

KAREN (V.O.)
One night Billy Daniels sent us 
champagne. There was nothing like 
it.  I didn't think that there was 
anything strange in any of this --  
you know, a twenty-one-year-old 
kid with such connections.

CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S CAR - DAWN

HENRY and KAREN are sipping champagne from Copa glasses in 
car parked outside her house.

KAREN (V.O.)
He was an exciting guy. He was 
really nice. He introduced me to

nice to him. And he knew how to 
handle it.

DAY

ANGLE ON MARTY'S TELEVISION COMMERCIAL

WE SEE MARTY swimming the length of a pool, surrounded by 
adoring MODELS in bathing suits.

MARTY'S TV (V.O.)
They'll stay put even in a typhoon. 
And I should know. I'm the president 
of the company."

WE SEE MARTY and HENRY standing near television set 
commercial is repeated over and over.  MARTY is taking 
bets on the phone and complaining to HENRY. WE SEE an 
agitated JIMMY BURKE in BG poking at wigs and looking toward 
HENRY and MARTY

MARTY.
(complaining sotto 
voice to Henry 
while taking bets 
on the phone)
Jimmy's busting my chops.
(into phone)
Okay, give 'em eight to five on 
Cleveland.
(hangs up phone and 
to Henry, while 
nervously eyeing 
in the other room)
He wants three points over the 
vig.  From me?   I don't believe 
this shit?

HENRY
(pleading)
Marty.  Please.  You know Jimmy. 
You borrowed his money.  Pay 'em.

MARTY
(so outraged his 
voice gets loader)
I didn't agree to three points 
over the vig.- What am I nuts? I 
didn't need it that much.

HENRY
(getting exasperated)
What are you gonna do? Fight with 
him?  He wants his money.

MAJKTY
Fuck 'em.  I never paid points.  I 
always did the right thing. Did I 
ever bust his balls?  Did I?  Did 
I?  I could have dropped a dime a 
million times,  and I wouldn't 
have had to pay dick.

HENRY
(getting annoyed)
Marty, you're talking crazy. Drop 
a dime? Call the cops? Don't even 
let anybody hear such bullshit.  
Hey don't you just pay the man his 
money and shut the fuck up.

WE SEE JIMMY in BG start toward HENRY and MARTY when he 
hears HENRY raise his voice.

WE SEE JIMMY come up behind MARTY and wrap the long 
telephone extension cord around MARTY's neck.  WE SEE 
MARTY's eyes begin to pop. WE SEE HENRY try to get his 
hands between the wire and MARTY's neck while trying to 
get JIMMY to stop.

JIMMY
(total fury)
You got money for your bullshit 
television, don't you?  I gotta 
watch you swimming back and forth 
on TV all night long, don't I?  
You got money for that, but you 
don't have my money?

HENRY
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good 
for it. Relax.

WE SEE MARTY nodding in agreement that he will pay. 
Suddenly, the phone rings.

WE SEE JIMMY, HENRY and MARTY frozen for a second.  WE SEE 
JIMMY relax the cord. WE SEE MARTY pick up the phone. The 
extension cord is still loosely wrapped around his neck.

MARTY
(handing Henry the 
phone)
It's for you.

HENRY takes the phone.

HENRY
(fury crosses his 
face)
Wait there.

HENRY races out the door, leaving MARTY and JIMMY docilely 
looking after him as he runs out the door.

EXT. ROADSIDE TELEPHONE BOOTH ON HIGHWAY

WE SEE KAREN waiting at booth as HENRY pulls up.

INT. HENRY'S CAR

KAREN
(crying and 
disheveled)
I've known him all my life. He 
just started grabbing at me. He 
wouldn't stop. And when I hit him 
across the nose with my shoe, he 
got mad and shoved me over.

EXT. KAREN'S PARENTS HOUSE

HENRY's car is parked at the curb. A new red Corvette is 
parked across the street.

HENRY
Go inside. I'll be right there.

KAREN
What are you gonna do?

HENRY
Get inside!

When KAREN gets out of the car, WE SEE HENRY reach under 
the seat for a snub-nose .38 revolver.

EXT. CORVETTE DRIVEWAY

WE SEE HENRY walk down driveway to the backyard area where 
BRUCE and TWO of his BROTHERS are talking.  BRUCE sees 
HENRY and walks toward him.  BRUCE'S TWO BROTHERS are 
smirking.

BRUCE
What do you want?

They get closer.

BRUCE
(annoyed and menacing)
Hey!  Fucko! You want something?

With absolutely no warning, HENRY reaches out and grabs 
BRUCE's hair with one hand and pulls his gun out of his 
waistband with the other. In almost one motion, HENRY

Smashes the gun across BRUCE's face. Teeth fall from BRUCE's 
mouth. The TWO BROTHERS, still not seeing the gun, start 
toward HENRY, but HENRY continues to pound the gun into 
BRUCE'S face like a dinner gong.  BRUCE's head is still 
off the ground only because HENRY refuses to let go of his 
hair.  BRUCE'S BROTHERS realize HENRY has a gun. They freeze 
and back off.

WOMAN'S VOICE
(from a window)
HELP! Police! He's got a gun!  
Police!  Quick!  Murder!

HENRY drops BRUCE to the ground.

EXT. KAREN'S DRIVEWAY

WE SEE KAREN standing at the side door as HENRY races up 
and puts something in her hand.

HENRY
(panting)
Here, hold this.

WE SEE KAREN look down.

CUT TO:

KAREN'S HAND

holding gun.

CLOSE UP - GUN

KAREN (V.O.)
I know there are women,  like my 
best friends, who would have gotten 
out of there the minute their 
boyfriend gave them a gun to hide.  
"Fha!  You and your gun. Get out 
of here, who needs you?"  That's 
what they would have said to him.  
But I didn't. I've got to admit 
the truth.  It turned me on.

WE SEE KAREN look around to make sure no one else has seen 
her. She then leans over and hides the gun in the milk box 
at her feet.

INT. KAREN'S PARENTS' HOUSE

WE SEE hands carefully wrapping a white linen table napkin 
around some object. WE SEE the napkin and object placed on 
the fleer. WE SEE a MAN's heel cone down and smash the 
object:, which turns out to be a wine glass. We are at a 
small Jewish living room wedding with a canopy and RABBI 
and it was HENRY who broke the glass as a part of the 
ritual.  KAREN'S PARENTS are glumly looking on. HENRY'S 
PARENTS are even glummer. Only MICHAEL, HENRY's brother in 
the wheelchair, looks pleased.

INT. CHATEAU BLEU CATERING HALL

PAULIE VARIO, FRENCHY, MARTY KRUGMAN, TOMMY DESIMONE, and 
ALL of their WIVES and FIANCEES are present.

JUMP CUTS TO PAUL VARIO presiding at a sort of line, 
introducing KAREN to the VARIO FAMILY and GUESTS.  HENRY 
stands behind KAREN, smiling proudly.

KAREN (V.O.)
It was like he had two families. 
The first time I was introduced to 
them all at once, it was crazy.  
Paulie and his brothers had lots 
of sons and nephews and almost all 
of them were named Peter or Paul. 
It was unbelievable. There must 
have been two dozen Peters and 
Pauls at the wedding. Plus, they 
were all married to girls named 
Marie, and they named all their 
daughters Marie. By the time I 
finished meeting everybody. I 
thought I was drunk.

CUT TO:

HENRY AND KAREN'S TABLE

Seated nearby are a beaming JIMMY BURKE and his wife, MICKEY 
BURKE.

WE SEE VARIO approach and hand KAREN an envelope.

VARIO
Here.  This is for you.

KAREN
(looking down at 
the envelope)
Paulie, you shouldn't.

WE SEE that VARIO's envelope is richly embossed with hearts 
and flowers and has a clear window in front through which 
she can see several neatly-folded hundred, dollar bills. 
When KAREN looks up, she sees that EVERY WISEGUY and his 
WIFE are lined up before her and that they are ALL holding 
envelopes with clear windows in front.

CUT TO:

KAREN

perspiring a little as she accepts and thanks the DOZENS 
OF WISEGUYS giving her the envelopes. WE ALSO SEE HENRY 
has opened a plastic supermarket shopping bag under the 
table where he is stuffing the envelopes just as soon as 
KAREN accepts them.

CUT TO:

HENRY AND KAREN getting up to dance.

KAREN
(whispering)
My bag. My bag.

HENRY
(amused)
What bag?

KAREN
(desperate)
The bag with the envelopes.

HENRY
(chiding)
Oh that. Don't worry about that. 
Nobody's gonna steal it.

INT. KAREN'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

WE SEE KAREN propped up, awake, in a chair.  Her FATHER is 
seated on a sofa, asleep.  KAREN'S MOTHER is looking out 
the window.

KAREN'S MOTHER
He didn't call?

KAREN
He's with his friends.

KAREN'S MOTHER
What kind of person doesn't call?

KAREN
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have 
to call every five minutes.

KAREN'S MOTHER
If he was so grown up he'd get you 
two an apartment.

KAREN
Don't bring that up. You're the 
one who wanted us here.

KAREN'S MOTHER
(ignoring the charge)
Look. He's got the whole house in 
an uproar.

CUT TO:

FATHER dozing on sofa.

KAREN'S MOTHER
He's got your father upset. Good 
thing he doesn't have to go to 
work in the morning. Is this what 
he deserves?

KAREN
Ma!  Please! You're driving me 
crazy.

KAREN'S MOTHER
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me 
started.  You're here a month and 
sometimes I know he doesn't come 
home at all. What kind of people 
are these?

KAREN
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to 
do?

KAREN'S MOTHER
Do?  What can you do?  What did 
you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did 
you know bow they live?  Your father 
would never stay out this late 
without calling.  In thirty years 
he never stayed out all night.

CUT TO:

FATHER SLEEPING ON SOFA

KAREN
Stayed out? Daddy never went out 
at all.

DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE UP - 6:30 A.M.

We hear car door open in front of house.

CUT TO:

KAREN AND KAREN'S MOTHER

open the door together and WE SEE HENRY standing in doorway, 
a little drunk.

Behind HENRY WE SEE a car with TOMMY DESIMONE still parked 
at the curb.

KAREN is happy to see him. She smiles.

KAREN'S MOTHER
(angrily)
Where were you? Where have you 
been? Why didn't you call? We were 
all worried to death! A married 
man doesn't stay out like this!

WE SEE HENRY look at KAREN, look at KAREN'S MOTHER and 
turn around and get back in the car and drive away.

KAREN BEGINS TO CRY.

KAREN'S FATHER sleepily comes to the door.

KAREN'S MOTHER
(as Henry drives 
away)
Normal people don't live this way.

INT. LIVING ROOM - JIMMY AND MICKEY'S ARCHIE-BUNKER HOUSE - 
NIGHT

KAREN and MOST of the WOMEN we saw at the wedding are at 
MICKEY's cosmetic party. There are large cardboard posters 
of glamorous models using the cosmetic's at MICKEY'S feet.

KAREN (V.O.)
We weren't married to nine-to-five 
guys, but the first time I realized 
how different was when Mickey had 
a hostess party.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Brushing another woman, ANGIE's, hair while showing off a 
new brush.

MICKEY
(to Angie)
Angie, sweetheart, you want it 
fluff?

CUT TO:

ANGIE'S TIRED FACE

black-ringed eyes and thin mouth.

ANGIE
He's the one with the hands. I'd 
like to smack his face.

WOMAN #1
The red-haired guy?  He looks a 
like a farmer?

ANGIE
Sonofabitch.  I swear.  You can't 
go through the gate without his 
hands.  I told him.  Keep' your 
fucking hands off, you Sonofabitch,  
or I'll cut them off.

WE SEE the WOMEN laugh.

ANGIE)
He don't know bow lucky he is. It 
I just mentioned it to Vince, I 
don't even want to know.

WOMAN #1
That's the problem.  How can you 
mention it? Vince 'd kill him.

ANGIE
You think I don't know? You think 
I like to keep this inside? But I 
gotta, or he'll kill the miserable 
bastard and he'll be there for 
life. It's disgusting what you 
have to put up with.

MICKEY
(while fluffing 
Angle's hair)
Look at Jeannie's kid.

ANGIE
What? What happened?

MICKEY
The oldest one.  He was in an 
argument. A lousy ten-dollar card 
game. The kid pulls out a gun. It 
goes off. The kid gets killed. The 
grandmother hears it and finds out 
he's been arrested. She has a heart 
attack.  She drops dead right on 
the spot. Now Jeannie's got a 
husband and son in jail and a mother 
in the funeral parlor.

ANGIE
But he was always a bad kid, that 
one.

MICKEY
No. Come on. It was the younger 
one that was the bad one.

KAREN (V.O.)
(continuing over 
dialogue)
They had bad skin and wore too 
much makeup. I mean they didn't 
look very good. They looked beat-
up.

CLOSE UP - WOMEN

Talking.

KAREN (V.O.)
You never saw teeth like that where 
I was growing up and the stuff 
they wore was thrown together and 
cheap. A lot of pants suits and 
double-knits. And they talked about 
how rotten their kids were and 
about beating them with broom 
handles and leather belts, but 
that the kids still didn't pay any 
attention. When Henry picked me 
up, I was dizzy.

INT. BEDROOM - KAREN'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

WE SEE they are getting ready for bed.

KAREN
I Don't know. I don't know if I 
could live that way. What if, God 
forbid, you go to prison. Mickey 
said Jeannie's husband --

HENRY
(angrily interrupting)
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband 
went to the can just to get away 
from her, she's such a pain in the 
ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes 
to jail unless they want to, unless 
they make themselves get caught. 
They do stuff with the wrong people. 
They don't have things organized. 
You know who goes to jail? Nigger 
stickup men. That's who. And they 
only get caught because they fall 
asleep in the getaway car.

KAREN looks down.  She listening.

HENRY
Listen, we're beginning to make 
real money for the first time. 
It's business. Do you think I'm 
going to walk away from that?

HENRY puts his arm around KAREN and begins to hug her.

KAREN (V.O.)
After a while, it all got to be 
normal. None of it seemed like 
crimes. It was more that Henry was 
enterprising. That he and the guys 
were making a few bucks hustling, 
while other men were sitting on 
their asses waiting for handouts. 
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons. 
They were blue collar guys, and 
the only way they could get extra 
money, real extra money, was to go 
out and cut a few corners.

CUT TO:

INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

ANGLE ON  HENRY AND TOMMY

He hear HENRY's laughter.

KAREN (V.O.)
And we were also very close. I 
mean, there were never any outsiders 
around. Absolutely never!  And 
being together all the time made 
everything seem even more normal.

INT. HENRY'S DOORWAY

WE SEE KAREN looking at a search warrant being shown to 
her by DETECTIVES who are being very polite. The CHILDREN 
are looking on.

KAREN (V.O.)
There was always a little 
harassment. They always wanted to 
talk to Henry about this or that. 
They'd come with their subpoenas 
and warrants and make me sign.  
But mostly they were just looking 
for a handout. A few bucks to keep 
things quiet, no matter what they 
found.

KAREN
(signing the paper)
Can I make you some coffee?

The DETECTIVES smile and, taking off their hats, walk into 
the house where KIDS and KAREN resume watching TV.

KAREN (V.O.)
I always asked them if they wanted 
coffee. Some of the wives, like 
Mickey Burke, used to curse at 
them and spit on the floor. Imagine. 
She'd spit on her own floor.   
That never made any sense to me.  
It was better to be polite and 
call the lawyer.

Anniversaries. Christenings.  We 
only want to each other's houses.

go out and risk his neck just to 
get us the little extras.

INT. HENRY AND KAREN'S SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

ANGLE ON HENRY'S BEDROOM CLOSET

He is on his way out.

KAREN

I'm gonna need some money.

HENRY

apart.

WE SEE HENRY take about an inch and a half of money from 
his inside jacket pocket, slap it on the table and go out 
the door.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

A plush, overdecorated cocktail lounge and nightclub on 
Queens Boulevard, where we hear Sergio Pranchi on the 
jukebox.

(NOTE:  REPLAY THE OPENING OF THE FILM AT 9 TIMES NORMAL 
SPEED -- HENRY SLAMMING THE TRUNK CLOSED.)

HENRY (V.O.)
For most of the guys, killing got 
to be accepted. They were routine.  
Murder was the only way everybody 
stayed in line. It was the ultimate 
weapon. Yon got out of line, you 
got whacked. Everyone knew the 
rules.

CUT TO:

TOMMY SMASHING GUN INTO BILLY BATT'S HEAD

HENRY (V.O.)
But sometimes, even if people didn't 
get out of line, they'd get whacked. 
Hits just became a habit for some 
guys. It didn't take anything to 
get yourself killed.

CUT TO:

SILHOUETTE OF TOMMY, HENRY AND JIMMY

Stuffing BILLY'S body into the trunk.

HENRY (V.O.)
Guys would get into arguments over 
nothing and before you knew it, 
one of them was dead. They were 
shooting each other all the time. 
Shooting people was a normal thing. 
It was no big deal.

CUT TO:

TOMMY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN AND BREAKFAST.

HENRY (V.O.)
You didn't have to do anything and 
nobody was immune. You just had to 
be there.

CUT TO:

TOMMY

smashing shovel into soft, bloodied matress cover in the 
trunk of the car.

HENRY (V.O.)
But we had a problem with Billy 
Batts. This was a touchy thing. 
Tommy had killed a made man. Billy 
was a part of the Bambino crew and 
untouchable.

CUT TO:

EXT.  CONNECTICUT WOODLAND - NIGHT

WE SEE TOMMY, HENRY and JIMMY burying BATTS.

HENRY (V.O.)
Before you could touch a made guy, 
you had to have a good reason. 
There had to be a sit-down. And 
you better get an okay, or you'd 
be the one who got whacked.

HENRY slams down trunk.

Last week I saw Sunny Davis. What 
a performer. You gotta see him. 
You gotta catch him. He does 
imitations I swear you'd think it 
was the real people.

GIRL #2
Yeah, the way he moves. It's 
unbelievable. I mean, you can 
understand how a white girl could 
fall for him.

TOMMY
What are you talking about?

GIRL #2
I don't mean me.  Not me. I just 
mean, you can see how some girls 
could.  Like that Swedish girl. 
You can see how she fell for him. 
You can see how he has this, this, 
personality.

Sunday. There are LOTS OF RELATIVES and FRIENDS present. 
HENRY and KAREN arrive. KAREN ia carrying their NEW BABY 
and HENRY has his TWO-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER by the hand. A

Great fuss is made over the NEW BABY and over KAREN by the 
WOMEN, including VARIO'S WIFE. VARIO puts an arm around 
HENRY and leads him into an alcove.

VARIO
What did you hear about that thing?

HENRY
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?

VARIO
No. No. The guy from downtown.

HENRY
The guy from near where Christie 
used to live?

VARIO
No. The other one. The one who 
disappeared up the block from 
Christie. The one they made a beef 
on.

HENRY
Oh I Him.

VASIO
You know the one I mean?

HENRY
Oh yeah. Sure. That guy. I know 
him.

VASIO
That Batts was a miserable fuck, 
but his people are looking still 
for him.

HENRY
Oh yeah. Yeah. I know. I even looked 
into it myself. Nobody knows what 
the fuck happened to him. He came 
in the joint that one night and 
then he disappeared.

VARZO
Hell, keep your eyes open. They're 
busting my balls looking for the 
fuck.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

HENRY and LINDA, with the CREW, are drinking. MARTY KRUGMAN 
is reluctantly paying off a bet at the bar. JIMMY calls 
HENRY aside.

JIMMY
We got a problem, that thing we 
took care of upstate?

HENRY
(surprised)
Paulie was just talking about him.

JIMMY
Well, we gotta dig him up again.

HENRY
(shocked)
What?

JIMMY
The guy just sold the property. 
They're gonna build condominiums 
and I don't want anybody digging 
up the little bastard.

HENRY
(horrified)
It's been six months.

JIMMY
It's still better than letting 
somebody find him.

HENRY
(nodding in agreement 
and concerned)
If Paulie finds out, we got 
problems.

JIMMY
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds 
we whacked him, we got real 
problems.

EXT. HENRY'S CAR PARKED ON DESERTED COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A hot summer night. The car trunk is open. HENRY, JIMMY

the stench, is wearing his handkerchief over his nose and 
mouth. HENRY looks at JIMMY and TOMMY. They do not appear 
to be bothered by the stench.

EXT. HENRY AND KAREN'S SUBURBAN HOME

HENRY is homing out the trunk of his car.  He has all of 
the mats, the spare tire, and the jack out of the trunk.

KAREN

prying)
I hit a skunk.

HENRY sprinkles in a bottle of perfume and slams the trunk 
shut.

INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

WE SEE LINDA showing off her new apartment to the GIRLS, 
including ROBIN, a sexy, dark-haired girl. We hear HENRY, 
TOMMY, SEPE and MANRI laughing in BG. The apartment is 
decorated in Ocean Parkway Ring. There are thick velvet-
covered sofa and blue-glass coffee table in bedroom and WE 
SEE a satin-covered, king-size bed with a doll propped 
against the pillows. WE SEE LINDA lean over and show her 
GIRLFRIENDS, including ROBIN, the bed ruffles.

HENRY (V.O.)
I set up Linda in an apartment 
around the corner from the Suite. 
That way I was able to stay over a 
couple of nights a week. Karen was 
home with the kids anyway and she 
never asked any questions anyway.

INT. BRIDAL SHOP - BACKROOM

HENRY is strangling the OWNER of a bridal shop with his 
own tie while TOMMY and JIMMY laugh.

HENRY (V.O.)
Linda and I were having so much 
fun, she started screwing up at 
work, and I had to straighten out 
her boss a little bit.

INT.  LINDA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS NIGHT

WE SEE LINDA suddenly lifted off her feet and thrown on 
the bed.  WE SEE HENRY and the GIRLS laughing.  As HENRY 
lifts LINDA off her feet, he winks at ROBIN, who smiles 
back.

INT. THE SUITE - A BASEMENT CARD SAME - NIGHT

Glazed walls, ornate sconces, and a rumpus room bar. HENRY, 
JIMMY, TOMMY and OTHER WISEGUYS are playing cards. TOMMY 
is a little drunk. SPIDER, a 22-year-old apprentice hood, 
is waiting on the PLAYERS, bringing then drinks. The sort, 
of thing we saw HENRY doing earlier. TOMMY is feeling 
expansive. He throws his jacket open TO REVEAL a gun tacked 
in his belt.

TOMMY
(impatiently)
Spider. C'mon, get me a seven and 
seven.

WE SEE SPIDER deliver a drink to HENRY and slowly back 
toward the bar.

TOMMY
Spider, what did I say? Did I say 
I was dying over here? Come on. 
Move it. Don't walk, dance.
(to his fellow 
players)
Did you ever see in the cowboy 
movies where they make them dance? 
Did you see The Oklahoma Kid, the 
only cowboy movie Cagney ever made? 
Come on, dance, you varmit.

WE SEE TOMMY taking out his guns.

SPIDER
Tommy, don't fuck around.

TOMMY
Yahooo.

HENRY
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the 
gun away. Tommy!

TOMMY
No, no. It's okay.

HENRY
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.

TOMMY
No. It's okay. Just watch this.  
Watch it.

The gun explodes and WE SEE SPIDER shot in the foot.

KAREN
I don't care. Something's going 
on.

HENRY
(exasperated)
That again.

KABEN

tears)
You're a liar. I look at you and I 
know you're a liar.

HE SEE HENRY pick up a large lamp and throw it at KAREN. 
He misses.

HENRY
(suddenly calm and 
walking out)
I need some air.  I need a little 
peace. At least at home.

WE SEE KABEN sit down on bed and begin to cry. We hear the 
CHILDREN crying in BG.

INT. THE SUITE - BASEMENT CARD GAME - NIGHT

ANGLE ON SPIDER

With bandaged foot and HENRY walking in and TILT UP TO 
both of them.

JIMMY, TOMMY and SOME HOODS are playing cards.  TOMMY Is

TOMMY
Hey!  Look at this.  Fred Astaira, 
back from the wars. Can you believe 
this guy? That bandage. It's bigger 
than his foot.

SPIDER ignores him.

The card game is going on. Shirts are unbuttoned. The table 
filled with empty glasses. SPIDER limps over with drinks.

TOMMY
Spider. You're so full of shit. 
Even with that foot, I bet you can 
dance.

SPIDER puts the drinks down and tries to ignore TOMMY again.

TOMMY
Come on. Spider.  Come on. Let's 
see you dance.

SPIDER
Why don't you go fuck yourself.

JIMMY
(laughing)
Hey,  Spider.  That's very good. 
Did you hear, Spider?  The kid's 
got balls.  See, the kid's got 
balls.  He's a good kid.

SPIDER starts to limp proudly back to the bar.

JIMMY
(whispering to Tommy)
You going to take that shit from 
this punk?  This fuckin'  low-life. 
This kid's got bigger balls than 
you'll have any day.  He just got 
shot in the foot by you and he 
tells you to go fuck yourself.  I 
can't believe this shit.
(to the crew, roaring 
with laughter)
Can you believe this shit?
(To Tommy, almost 
whispering)
Tommy! You gonna take that shit 
from a punk?

The PLAYERS are all laughing loudly. SPIDER is proudly 
standing near the bar. And, before anyone has any idea of 
what is about to happen, TOMMY pulls out one of his two 
guns and puts three deafening shots into SPIDER'S chest.

EVERYONE is frozen in silence. HENRY is upset by shooting. 
There is a long pause.

JIMMY
All right, you dumb fuck, if you're 
going to be a big fuckin' wiseguy, 
you can dig the hole.

WE SEE a frowning TOMMY get up from table and slowly begin 
moving chairs around to get ready to dig the hole.

KAREN'S TRIGGER FINGER

KAREN (V.O.)
The truth was, that no matter how

HENRY

head away and 
grabbing the gun)
Son of a bitch.

WE SEE HENRY slap KAREN across the face and knock her off 
the bed.

HENRY

come home to get whacked?

WE SEE KAREN crying.

HENRY
I swear on my mother, I should 
kill you. You're fucking crazy.

walk toward the kitchen. The place is in disarray.

HENRY
(to Linda)
Honey.  Go get me some cigarettes.

LINDA leaves without saying a word.

VARIO
(after watching the 
door close)
Karen's come to the house. She's 
very upset. It's no good. You gotta 
straighten this all out.

HENRY looks down.

JIMMY
Things gotta be calm right now, 
and Karen's so high-strung. She's 
with Mickey every day. Who knows 
what she's gonna do?

VARIO
Jimmy and Tommy were supposed to 
pick up something in Tampa for me 
this weekend.

JIMMY nods in agreement.

VARIO (V.O.)
You go with Jimmy, instead. Get 
away for a few days.  Relax.

CUT TO:

INT. REAR SEAT OF CAR - NIGHT

WE SEE MAM's bleeding face being punched.

VARIO (V.O.)
Enjoy yourselves. Have a good time. 
Then, when you get back Monday, 
you go home to Karen.

WE PULL BACK TO SEE JIMMY and HENRY beating a MAM who is 
squashed between them.

MAM
(pleading)
I ain't got it. I swear.

WE SEE JIMMY and HENRY beat him more.

MAN
(crying)
I can't.  I swear.

WE SEE JIMMY and HENRY look at each other.

EXT.  EXIT SIGN TO BUSCH GARDENS - TAMPA ZOO - NIGHT

We hear the roar of lions.

WE SEE JIMMY and HENRY drag the BOOKIE out of the car by 
his arms and legs just outside the zoo.

JIMMY
we're gonna feed the bastard to 
the lions.

HENRY
(while dragging 
bookie)
What lions? I'm not going near any 
lions.

JIMMY
We only have to shove'em over the 
moat.

WE SEE the MAN finally begin to squirm and scream.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROADSIDE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

ANGLE ON BLEEDING MAN

on phone with JIMMY and HENRY waiting outside.

HENRY (V.O.)
They must really feed each other 
to the lions down there, because 
the guy gave the money right up 
and we got to spend the rest of 
the weekend at the track.
(pause and genuine 
shock)
But then, I couldn't believe what 
happened.

CUT TO:

NEWSPAPER PICTURE

of HENRY and JIMMY getting arrested.

HENRY (V.O.)
When we got home, we were all over 
the newspapers. At first, I didn't 
even know why we got picked up.

CUT TO:

NEWSPAPER PHOTO

of MAN they beat being arrested with his head bandaged.

HENRY (V.O.)
Then, I found out, that the guy we 
roughed up turned out to have a 
sister working as a typist for the 
FBI.

GOVERNMENT OFFICE

where sobbing TYPIST is surrounded by MEN in business suits.

HENRY (V.O.)
Who could believe it? Of all the 
fucking people. She gave up 
everybody.  Jimmy.  Me. Even her 
brother.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

HENRY and JIMMY before JUDGE.  KAREN and CHILDREN crying 
in court. OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS present and crying.

HENRY (V.O.)
It took the jury six hours to bring 
us in guilty. The judge gave Jimmy 
and me ten years like he was giving 
away candy.

INT. MAXWELL'S PLUM - THE BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

TOMMY, MARTY KRUGMAN, JOE MANRI, STACKS EDWARDS, FRENCHY 
McMAHON, etc., are all having drinks with HENRY before he 
goes off to prison.

WE SEE by the bar clock that it is four o'clock.

Suddenly, KAREN comes charging into the bar.  She is angry. 
She has tracked HENRY down.

KAREN
(frantic)
I thought you were supposed to 
turn yourself in at ten o'clock 
this morning?

HENRY
I'm just having my last few drinks.

KAREN
I've been all over town. I got a 
call from the bondman.  He says 
they're going to rescind your bail 
if you don't show up and sign in 
right now. They're going to take 
away the house.

HENRY
Shit.

HENRY looks at his PALS, orders his last Screaming Eagle 
for a while, and gently touches the tips of KAREN'S fingers. 
He swallows his drink, hugs and kisses a tearful KAREN and 
walks out of the bar to a long, white, stretch limo waiting 
at the curb.

TOMMY
Say hello to Jimmy.

HENRY gets in the rear seat of the limo.

HENRY
(downing a plan 
full of valium)
Okay, now you can take me to jail.

CUT TO:

INT. DORMITORY - LEWISBURG FEDERAL PRISON

CLOSE UP - GARLIC

being sliced razor thin.

HENRY (V.O.)
Dinner was always a big thing. We 
had a pasta course and then meat 
or fish.  Paulie did the prep work.  
He was doing a year for contempt 
and he had a system for doing 
garlic. He used a razor and he 
sliced it so thin it used to liquify 
in the pan with a little oil.

CUT TO:

HOT PLATE

with a pot full of tomato sauce and meatballs being stirred.

HENRY (V.O.)
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato 
sauce.  I felt he put in too many 
onions, but it was a good sauce 
anyway.

CUT TO:

FRYING PAN

With smoking steaks.

HENRY (V.O.)
Johnny Dio did the meat. He didn't 
have a broiler, so Johnny did 
everything in pans.  He smelled up 
the joint something awful and the 
hacks used to die.

CUT TO:

HOT FLAT

Hooked up by long extension cord to an electric outlet in 
the toilet. There are huge kitchen knives, a block of ice 
in a tin pail covered with a cloth and large pots and 
colanders necessary for cooking pasta dishes.

PULL BACK to a large dorm with four beds separated by 
shoulder-height partitions. The room does not look like a 
prison. There are curtains over the bars. The room is filled 
with smoke from the pan-fried steak.

HENRY (V.O.)
Everybody else in the joint was 
doing real time, all mixed together, 
living like pigs.

CUT TO:

HENRY

In grey prison garb, carrying a heavy canvas mail sack 
marked "LEWISBURG PRISON." He dumps the sacks on one of 
the beds.

HENRY (V.O.)
We lived alone, we owned the joint. 
Even those hacks who we couldn't 
bribe would never rat on the guys 
who did.

CUT TO:

HENRY

opens the sack on his bad and pulls out bottles of wine, 
scotch, and brandy, and holds them aloft.

HENRY
(looking for praise)
Nice? Good?

VARZO
(looking up from 
his garlic surgery)
Okay. What else?

WE SEE HENRY reach in the sack and pull out cheeses, dried 
sausages, a large jar of vinegar peppers and dried 
mushrooms.

VARIO
(beaming with pride)
Now we eat.

WE SEE HENRY begin to set the table.

CUT TO:

VARIO AND THE REST OF TEE MOB BOSSES

playing cards, sipping wine, scotch and brandy. HENRY is 
sitting on his bed with his back to the GROUP. When he 
sees that no one is watching him, he pulls a black plastic 
garbage bag out of the sack.  HENRY opens the bag and 
quickly counts the clear plastic bags of marijuana, glassine 
envelopes of heroin and bottles of pills. HENRY quickly 
repacks the drugs and slips them under his covers.

INT.  PRISON ENTRY GATE - DAY

Visiting day.  HENRY is in a GUARD'S booth watching the 
VISITORS' gate through a window.  WE SEE a GUARD in the 
room with HENRY. There is a knock. The GUARD opens the 
door and looks at HENRY. HENRY nods. The GUARD lets the 
INMATE enter. While the GUARD watches, the INMATE gives 
HENRY some cash and HENRY gives him one of the plastic 
bags filled with marijuana and a bottle of pills. The INMATE 
is then escorted out by the GUARD who closes the door.

GUARD
Are there any more?

HENRY
(looking intently 
at the visiting 
gate)
No, that's it. Ho more today.

WE SEE HENRY casually stuff some bills into the GUARD'S 
shirt pocket.

CUT TO:

INT. VISITORS' GATE - DAY

ANGLE ON KAREN

coming through. She is wearing such a large, oversized 
coat that KAREN looks twice as big as she was when we last 
saw her. She has the TWO CHILDREN with her. She is carrying 
a large purse and some empty shopping bags. The GUARDS see 
her and immediately help her get through the metal detection 
device and past the table where OTHER WOMEN are emptying 
the contents of their bags and packages.

CUT TO:

REGISTRATION DESK where KAREN quickly signs the visitors' 
book.

CUT TO:

GUARD'S GRINNING FACE

WE SEE him turn page of book so KAREN can see the name of 
another of HENRY's visitors.

CUT TO:

PAGE OF BOOK WE SEE name, 'Linda Rossi" written next to 
BILL, HENRY.

CUT TO:

INT.  PRISON VISITING ROOM

PAN BACK to a large gymnasium filled with formica tables 
and cheap plastic chairs at which WE SEE PRISONERS and 
their WIVES and CHILDREN eating, talking, crying and, in 
discreet corners -- hidden behind makeshift screens of 
shopping bags and scarves -- having oral sex.

WE SEE that the bored GUARDS are indifferent to what is 
happening.

CUT TO:

TABLE

HENRY and KAREN are talking while WE SEE the CHILDREN 
playing in the distance at the commissary food machines.

KAREN
(fuming)
You son of a bitch. She's been 
here.

HENRY
(acting dumb)
What are you talking about?

KAREN
(gottcha)
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in 
the register.

HENRY
Jezuz Christ!

KAREN
You want her to visit you?  Good!  
Let her stay up all night crying 
and writing letters to the parole 
board.

HENRY
(astounded)
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm 
in jail. I can't stop people from 
coming to see me.

WE SEE KAREN open her coat revealing large inside pockets 
where she has stowed salamis, wine, cigarettes, cartons, 
etc.

KAREN
You want her?  Good!  Let her sneak 
this stuff in for you!

WE SEE KAREN slam a salami on the table with such a thud 
that the other PRISONERS and WIVES turn around.

KAREN
Let her fight with these creep 
bastards every week to make life 
easier for you!

WE SEE KAREN slam down cigarettes and wine with a thud, 
this time WE SEE a GUARD turn around and look at KAREN and 
HENRY and the contraband on the table. Pause.  WE SEE the 
GUARD turn his head away.

HENRY
(desperate)
Stop! Stop!

KAREN
Let her carry this shit inside.

WE SEE KAREN boldly wave a Baggie filled with marijuana 
and some plastic medicine containers with pills.

HENRY grabs the narcotics out of KAREN's hand and grabs 
her.  WE SEE HENRY hug KAREN to him and WE SEE her drop 
her arms and hug him.

KAREN
(quietly sobbing)
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got 
four years. Marty and Fran are 
broke.  I asked your friend Remo 
for the money he owed you, and you 
know what he told me?

HENRY
(stroking her head 
and soothing her)
It'll be okay.

KAREN
He told me to take the kids to the 
police station and make the cops 
put me on welfare.

WE SEE HENRY take the drugs from KAREN's hand and slip it 
into his shirt.

HENRY
We've got to help each other.

KAREN
Even Paulie, since he got out, I 
hardly see him.

HENRY
It's only you and me. That's what 
happens when you go away. We're on 
our own. Forget everybody.  Forget 
Paulie.  As long as he's on parole 
he doesn't want anybody doing 
anything.

KAREN
(sobbing)
I can't do it anymore.

HENRY
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. 
We'll be fine. All I need is for 
you to keep bringing the stuff.  
I've got a guy in here from 
Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. 
Believe me, in a month we'll be 
fine. We won't need anybody.

KAREN
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie 
finds out.

HENRY
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he 
helping you? Is he putting food on 
the table? We've got to help 
ourselves. We just have to be 
careful while we do it.

KAREN
(looking in his 
face)
I don't want to hear about her 
anymore.

HENRY
(hugging her to him)
Never.

DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE - FOUR YEARS LATER

EXT.  PRISON GATE - DAY

HENRY comes out in civilian clothes. WE SEE his face drop. 
PAN over to the beat-up old car.  KAREN is behind the wheel. 
HENRY gets in.

INT.  KAREN'S SMALL, CRAMPED APARTMENT

The signs of wealth are long gone. HENRY sees that KAREN 
has been living four tough, lean years.

Their DAUGHTERS are watching as HENRY looks around the 
house.

HENRY
(smiling faintly)
Get packed.  We're getting out of 
here.

KAREN
With what?

HENRY
(smiling, slyly)
Don't worry with what. You just 
start looking for a new place. I'm 
going to Pittsburgh in the morning. 
The guys from Pittsburgh they owe 
me fifteen grand from our little 
partnership and it's only the 
beginning.

KAREN
But you've got to see your parole 
officer in the afternoon and
(whispering)
I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. 
Schwarz.

HENRY
Don't worry about it. You listening 
to me? Now, come on. We gotta go 
see Paulie.

CUT TO:

INT. VARIO'S HOUSE - DAY

ANGLE ON PLATTERS OF FOOD

Coming out of the kitchen and placed on the table.

CUT TO:

DOCK - IN REAR OF VARIO'S HOUSE

DISSOLVE TO:

VARIO AND HENRY walking toward the edge of the dock.

VARIO
I don't want any more of that Shit.

HENRY
Wha?  Me?

VARIO
Just stay away from the garbage.  
Yon know what I mean.

HENRY
(shocked)
Me? Why would I get into that shit?

VARIO
(interrupting)
I know what you did inside. You 
did what you had to do. I'm not 
talking about that.  I'm talking 
from now on, outside. I'm talking 
right here.

HENRY
Why would I get into that?

VARZO
Don't make me a fool. You know 
what I mean, from now on, you gotta 
be careful. Just don't mess around 
with that shit, and watch out for 
Jimmy. Jimmy's a good earner, but 
he's sometimes too hungry. He's 
wild.  He does foolish things.  
Jimmy is not a businessman. As 
good as he is, he takes too many 
chances.

HENRY
I know that.  I know Jimmy. You 
think I'd take chances like Jimmy?

VARZO
And that Tommy. He's a good kid, 
but he's crazy. He's a cowboy. 
He's got too much to prove. You 
got to watch out for kids like 
that.

HENRY
Paulie, I know.  I know what they 
are. But I use them for certain 
things.  Please. Believe me, you 
don't nave to worry.

VARIO
(not even listening 
to Henry's protest)
I'm not going to get fucked like 
Gribbs. He's seventy years old and 
the fucking guy is going to die in 
prison.  I don't need that. I don't 
care who it is. I'm warning 
everybody. Gribbs got twenty years 
just because he said hello to some 
fuck who was sneaking around selling 
junk behind his back. That's not 
going to happen to me.  You 
understand?

HENRY
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

VARIO
You're only home early because we 
got you a job, right? And I don't 
need any heat. You understand?

HENRY
Nods.

VARIO
And, if you hear about anybody 
else fucking around with that shit, 
you tell me.

HENRY
Nods again.

VARIO
(gently slappinq 
Henry on the cheek)
Anybody!  You understand?

HENRY
I understand.

INT.  ROBIN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT - DAY

ANGLE ON ROBIN'S HANDS

CUT TO:

mixing coke in metal bowl. WE SEE HENRY standing behind 
her.  ROBIN is an intense, sexy, 30-year-old, divorced.

Ex-airport clerk. (ROBIN is described earlier in SCENE #75 
page 58, where she flirts with HENRY.)  The apartment is a 
jumbled mess and even the table where she is cutting the 
drugs is littered with old coffee caps, newspapers, and 
day-old dirty dishes.

HENRY (V.O.)
It took me about a week of sneaking 
around before I could unload the 
Pittsburgh stuff without Paulie 
finding out. But when I did, it 
was a real score.  I started using 
Robin's place to mix the stuff and 
even with Robin's snorting more 
than she mixed, I could see this 
was a good business. I made twelve 
thousand dollars in my second week 
and I had a down-payment on my 
house. All I had to do was every 
once in a while, tell Robin I loved 
her.

CUT TO:

INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY TIGHT ON A PIECE OF PAPER

where stubby pencil calculations are being scribbled.

HENRY (V.O.)
It was perfect. As long as I kept 
getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, 
I knew Paulie would never find 
out. But within a couple of weeks 
it got to be so big I needed help.  
I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in 
with me.

HENRY (O.S.)
Fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-
one-five.

CUT TO:

HENRY

opening a shoe box he has hidden in a plastic grocery bag. 
JIMMY and TOMMY lean close to HENRY in order to see inside.

HENRY
(smiling)
Did I tell you?

CUT TO:

OPEN SHOE BOX

filled with twenty-dollar bills.

JIMMY (O.S.)
Nice.

TOMMY
Who's buying?

WE SEE HENRY's thumb run through the tightly-stacked 
twenties like piano keys.

CUT TO:

PAROLE OFFICER

in tired business suit coming out of door, over which WE 
SEE sign reading "UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - 
PAROLE DIVISION," and WE SEE that HENRY, JIMMY and TOMMY 
are in the large brightly lit Parole Office counting their 
drug profits.

PAROLE OFFICER
(overworked and 
looking around the 
crowded waiting 
room)
Burke?

WE SEE JIMMY and PAROLE OFFICER walk into the office.

PAROLE OFFICER
Still working?

Door closes.

CUT BACK TO:

A WHOLE FLOOR

filled with EX-CON PAROLEES.

CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S NEW HOUSE

WE SEE MARTY KRUGMAN and his wife, FRAN, being taken on a 
tour of an over-decorated and expensive living room.

(SHOT almost like a commercial)

KAREN (O.S.)
This we had to have made special. 
I mean, sit in it. Go ahead. Sit.

FRAN plops onto sofa.

KAREN (O.S.)
The others you couldn't even sit 
in.  And from here, watch the wall.

KAREN's hand flicks a switch on table next to sofa and 
wall slides back, REVEALING TV and stereo.

KAREN (O.S.)
See. It opens. We had the 
electricians fix it up special.

CUT TO:

LARGE MARBLE-TOP TABLE

KAREN
This we imported. It came in two 
pieces.

On third object, PAN TO KAREN.

As KAREN and FRAN KRUGMAN disappear behind swinging kitchen 
doors, MARTY and HENRY drop onto the sofa.

MARTY
It's a fait accompli?

HENRY
Done.

MARTY
And Jimmy's in it, right?

HENRY
Will you stop.

HASTY
But you don't understand.  It's 
worth millions. It's once in a

MARTY
Lifetime. We'll be rich. No more 
nut every week. I've been 
cultivating this thing for two 
years.

INT. ROBERT'S LOUNGE

A SEEDY MOB HANGOUT. WE SEE ALL OF THE WISEGUYS WHO WILL 
BE A PART OF THE LUFTHANSA ROBBERY.  MARTY, HENRY, TOMMY, 
AND JIMMY ARE WATCHING A BASKETBALL GAME.

HENRY (V.O.)
And these are the guys.

CUT TO:

TOMMY AND ANGELO SEPE

who are leaning with their backs against the bar, their 
jackets open, bosses of all they survey.

HENRY (V.O.)
Tommy and Sepe were going to grab 
the outside guard and make him get 
us in the front door.

CUT TO:

FRENCHY MCMAHON

Who is playing shuffleball.

HENRY (V.O.)
Frenchy and

CUT TO:

JOE BUDDHA sprinkling sawdust on the shuffleboard table.

HENRY (V.O.)
Joe Buddha had to round up the 
workers.

CUT TO:

FAT LOUIE

watching the television with a drink in his hand.

HENRY (V.O.)
Fat Louis had to keep than tied up 
and away from alarms.

CUT TO:

MARTY

Shoving his way between JIMMY and HENRY at the bar and 
turning to the television basketball game.

HENRY
Only Marty was driving us nuts. He 
was busting Jimmy's balls for an 
advance on the money we were going 
to steal.

CUT TO:

STACKS EDWARDS

who is sitting at the bar, delicately stirring his drink 
with his pinky.

HENRY (V.O.)
Even Stacks got in on it.  He was 
supposed to steal the panel truck 
and afterwards compact it by a 
friend of ours in Jersey.

CUT TO:

INT. KAREN AND HENRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

ANGLE ON BABY

JUDY WICKS, a young, pale blonde woman, puts the BABY and 
an overnight bag on the bed as HENRY and KAREN watch.

HENRY
I had everybody working.  Even our 
old babysitter.

KAREN
(enthused)
She's beautiful.  Look at her. 
Henry, look at her.

HENRY
(singsong)
Hello!  Hello!
(to Judy)
Have a good flight?

JUDY
I hate Pittsburgh.

WE SEE JUDY WICKS unwrap the BABY'S pink snowsuit and take 
off its hood and mittens as HENRY opens JUDY's overnight 
bag and takes out some Pampers and then he takes out several 
plastic bags with cocaine and heroin.

JUDY
Where'd you find such creeps?

HENRY
They're okay and it's worth it. 
Ain't it?

KAREN
(playing with the 
baby)
Is this the same one as last time?

JUDY
(amazed that Karen 
can't tell the 
difference)
No. That one was my sister's. This 
is Louise's.

KAREN
Look at her, Henry, is she sweet? 
Doesn't she look like Judy?

JUDY
That's what the stewardess said.

WE SEE HENRY barely listening while putting the drugs in a 
paper bag.

CUT TO:

INT. ROBIN'S HOUSE

EXTREME CLOSE OF - COKEBALLS

COME BACK TO SEE HENRY at table making "cokeballs" in a 
metal press.

CUT TO:

LINE OF COKE ON A MIRROR

shoved under HENRY's nostril.

WE SEE straw inserted into HENRY's nostril as he casually 
inhales. He never stops pressing the cokeballs.

TRACK OUT TO ROBIN 'taking a snort herself, and the sloppy 
table with the drags, scales, mixers, bowls and sieves. 
ROBIN is razor-blading two more lines.

HEHRY
(watching out of 
the corner of his 
eye)
Hey! Watch out.

WE SEE ROBIN lick her finger and then run her finger across 
HENRY'S tongue. Be licks, but does not react as he takes 
several golf-ball-size cokeballs out of the machine and 
puts then in a leather pouch. Be gets up to leave.

ROBIN
Stay there.

HENRY
Don't start. I told you to clean 
up. Look at this place. It's a 
pigpen. Look around here. Why do 
you think I bought you the 
dishwasher? Look. Look at this.
(sticking his finger 
under Robin's nose)
There's enough powder around here 
to put us all away.

ROBIN
(licking Henry's 
finger and playfully 
pushing him into 
the chair)
I hate to do dishes.

HENRY
(sitting down again)
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.

ROBIN
(reaching over his 
shoulder toward 
his crotch)
So do I.

WE SEE HENRY look at his watch.

INT.  ROBIN'S SHOWER

HENRY is listening to the radio while taking his shower.

RADIO NEWS BROADCASTER (V.O.)
... and nobody knows for sure just 
how much was taken in the daring 
pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa 
cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.  
The FBI says two million dollars. 
Port Authority police say four 
million dollars, the city cops say 
five.  How much maximum? That they 
won't say. So far, Lufthansa has 
not said anything, but they've 
promised to break their silence 
soon with a press conference, and 
WINS will be there to cover it 
live from the scene of the heist 
at JFK when they do. It looks like 
a big one. Maybe the biggest this 
town has ever seen. Stay tuned ...

HENRY slams the soap onto the shower floor and pounds the 
wall with joy.

ROBIN (O.S.)
Are you okay? What happened?

HENRY
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's 
all.

EXT.  ROBERT'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

Private Christmas party. As they arrive, HENRY and KAREN 
are hugged by JIMMY in the doorway.  It is a Lufthansa 
victory party, but no one mentions the robbery.

JIMMY
(grabbing Henry 
around the neck 
and kissing his 
head)
Come here.
(to Karen)
Look at this genius.

JIMMY keeps his arms around HENRY and KAREN as FAT LOUIE 
CAFORA shows up with his new wife, DOLORES, who is also 
over 200 pounds. They are beaming with pride.

FAT LOUIE
(to Jimmy and Henry)
Come outside.  I gotta show you. 
Just for a minute.

WE SEE a new pink caddy convertible. The sticker is still 
in the window.

FAT LOUIE (O.S.)
Is that beautiful? I got it for 
Dolores.

JIMMY
(whispering angrily 
at Fat Louie)
You fucking nuts? Didn't I say not 
to go buy anything for a while? 
You got a fucking car?

FAT LOUIE
(trying to placate 
Jimmy as he enters 
the bar)
Don't get excited. It's okay. My 
mother bought it for us. It's a 
wedding present. It's in her name.

JIMMY
You're crazy. The bulls are across 
the street. They're watching 
everything we do.

CUT TO:

ROBERT'S LOUNGE - COPS IN FRONT

CUT BACK TO:

JIMMY as he watches Fat Louie walk into the bar.

JIMMY
(angrily whispering 
to Henry)
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

WE SEE a sailing ANGELO SEPE walk in the door and WE SEE 
that his WIFE is wearing a $30,000 sable coat.

JIMMY
Jesus Christ!  Are you all fucking 
nuts?

SEPE
(to Henry)
What's the matter with him?

Before HENRY can answer, WE SEE JIMMY start to grab the 
coat off MRS. SEPE's back.

SEPE
Hey? What the fuck are you doing?

MRS. SEPE
(hysteria risin)
Angelo!  He's taking my coat!  
Angelo!

Meanwhile, WE SEE JIMMY grabbing the coat off MRS. SEPE's 
back and begin to roll it up and shove it under SEPE's 
arm.

JIMMY
(furiously, to Sepe)
Didn't I tell you not to get 
anything big? Didn't I tell you 
not to attract attention? In two 
days, one fuck buys a Caddy and 
another buys a ten thousand dollar 
mink.
(to Henry)
Can you believe this shit?
(to Sepe, with some 
menace)
Now get the fuck home and get rid 
of the coat. Bring it back to where 
you got it. I don't care what you 
do, just get rid of it.

MRS. SEPE
(to Sepe, hysterical 
and angry)
I'm not giving it back. Angelo? Do 
you hear me?

WE SEE SEPE angrily grab his WIFE'S arm and leave.

SEPE
Did I tell you to shut up? Shut 
up!

JIMMY
(to Henry, as they 
walk toward the 
bar)
Fucking guys.  Can you believe 
them.  I told them all: Don't . 
attract attention.  Act normal.

At the bar, WE SEE STACKS EDWARDS and his GIRLFRIEND 
dropping shot glasses of green creme de menthe into large 
glasses of chilled DON Perignon. TOMMY and his GIRL-FOR-
THE-MIGHT are standing with STACKS and his GIRLFRIEND. 
TOMMY is wearing a shiny silk suit that practically glows 
with newness. WE SEE FRENCHY and BUDDHA with their WIVES. 
EVERYONE is dressed in new clothes and flashing gaudy rings.

JIMMY and HENRY move toward a quiet corner of the bar. WE 
SEE MARTY KRUGMAN suddenly burst in on them.

MARTY
Oh!  There you are.  I've been 
looking all over for you two.

HENRY and JIMMY stare at MARRY blankly.

MARTY
Listen, I need it, Jimmy.  I need 
it all.

JIMMY gets up to walk away without even looking at MARTY.

HEHRY
Marty.  Relax.  You saw some money.

MARTY
(continues anyway)
But I need it all.  I owe people 
too, you know.

WE SEE JIMMY walk toward small office in the back of the 
bar.

MARTY
Jimmy.  Wait.  Listen.  Please!

WE SEE that MARTY is about to follow JIMMY into the room, 
but HENRY stops him.

MARTY
I want to talk to Jimmy.

HENRY
He heard.

MARTY
But I got two hundred and fifty 
coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy 
owes me.

HENRY

into the backroom)
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.

expensive tree they had.

WE SEE KAREN and the CHILDREN excited by the presents 
REVEALED under the tree.  WE SEE KAREN kiss HENRY, who 
slips the thick packet of bills into the front of her dress.

HENRY
Go buy yourself a coat.

KAREN shivers with excitement.

CAMERA DOLLIES into tree.

HENRY

More than enough to go around.

Bending over to put on his shoes. We hear water in the 
sink.

CUT TO:

TOMMY pulling out a .38 caliber gun with a silencer from 
his belt.

HENRY (V.O.)
Stacks was always crazy. Instead 
of getting rid of the truck like 
he was supposed to, he got stoned, 
went to his girlfriend's and by 
the time he woke up, the cops had 
found the truck. It was all over 
the television. They even said 
they came up with prints off the 
wheel. It was just a matter of 
tine before they got to Stacks.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

CUT TO:

TOMMY

firing three silent shots into the back of STACKS' head.

INT. ROBERT'S LOUNGE - DAY

HENRY walks into the bar and WE SEE JIMMY, TOMMY, SEPE and 
MARTY. They are ALL celebrating.

JIMMY
(to the bartender)
Give'm a drink.

HENRY
(agitated, to Jimmy)
I gotta talk to you.

JIMMY
(as happy as he's 
ever been)
Have a drink first.

WE SEE HENRY swallow the drink in one gulp.

HENRY
I still gotta talk to you.

WE SEE JIMMY grab HENRY around the neck and head toward 
the rear men's room.

JIMMY

Oh yeah? Anything you say.

CUT TO:

MEN'S ROOM

HENRY
What's going on? What happened to 
Stacks? Is everything okay?

JIMMY
(smiling)
Don't worry about it.

HENRY
There are cops all over the place.

JIMMY
(smiling)
So what?  Where are they gonna go?

CUT TO:

A SMILING TOMMY

entering the men's room.

JIMMY
(to Tommy and barely 
able to suppress 
his glee)
He's worried.

TOMMY
(suddenly hugging 
Henry with happiness 
and affection))
Come on. Don't worry so fucking 
much. Things are beautiful.
(to Jimmy)
Didn't you tell him?

JIMMY
(wreathed in smiles)
Not yet.

HENRY gently breaks away from TOMMY'S hug. Stares at JIMMY.

JIMMY
Tommy's gonna be made.

HENRY is momentarily impressed.

HENRY
(incredulous)
Paulie's gonna make him?

JIMMY
(proudly grabbing 
Tommy's beaming 
face in his hands 
and kissing him)
Who else? Paulie got the okay. 
This little guinea fuck. Someday 
he's gonna be a boss. Can you 
believe someday we'll work for 
him.

HENRY hugs TOMMY and they leave the men's room.

CUT TO:

NARROW HALLWAY OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM ON HAY BACK TO BAR

CUT TO:

MARTY

standing in narrow hallway blocking HENRY, JIMMY and TOMMY.

MARTY
(smiling)
Jimmy, can I talk to you now?

WE SEE JIMMY and TOMMY angrily push right past MARTY.

MARTY
(annoyed and pleading 
with Henry as Jimmy 
and Tommy hurry 
past)
Hey! Come on, already. If it wasn't 
for me, none of you would have had 
anything.

WE SEE HENRY grab MARTY and shove him in the men's room 
and close the door.

HENRY
(angry)
Will you shut your fucking mouth. 
You're gonna get your money, just 
stop busting balls. Okay? Relax.  
You hear? Everything's gonna be 
fine.

WE SEE HENRY slam the bathroom door on MARTY and hurry 
back to the bar.

EXT.  ROBERT'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

WE SEE JIMMY and TOMMY leaving the bar after a long night. 
WE SEE MARTY outside waiting for them.

JIMMY
(bursts out laughing)
Son of a bitch. You're a pisser.

WE SEE MARTY begin to laugh, too. WE SEE JIMMY hug MARTY 
around the shoulder affectionately as they walk away from 
the bar.

JIMMY
You wanna talk? Okay, come on, 
let's get it over with.  I swear 
I've never known a ball buster 
like you in all my life.

MARTY
(all smiles)
Ah, but Jimmy, nobody loves you. 
like I do. You know that. You name 
it.  I'll do anything for you.

JIMMY

Except to stop busting my balls.

We hear tires squeal and two shots ring out.

CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We hear a doorbell, waking HENRY and KAREN from sleep.

WOMAN (O.S.)
Open up.  Henry! Karen! It's me.

WE SEE HENRY and RARER open the door and HE SEE FRAN KRUGMAN 
standing there in her housecoat, and distraught.

FRAN
(hysterical)
Marty didn't come home. He's 
missing. I know something happened 
to him.

HENRY
Wait a minute.  Calm down.

KAREN
Fran. It'll be okay. Don't worry.

FRAN
I know something happened.

HENRY
What could happen? He got drunk. 
He passed out somewhere. I'll go 
looking for him in the morning.

FRAN
In twenty years he's never been 
away all night without calling. I 
know something's wrong.

HENRY
Awright, awright. Let me take you 
home and I'll go look for him 
myself. Right now.

EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE SHERWOOD DINER - DAWN

HENRY and JIMMY are leaving together.

HENRY
What'll I tell Fran?

JIMMY
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran 
away with a broad. What do you 
care about her.

Suddenly JIMMY spots TWO FBI MEN who had been tailing him, 
dozing in their unmarked car. Be starts toward their car.

JIMMY
Watch this.

HENRY
Come on, don't fuck around, will 
ya?

JIMMY
I do it all the time. Bust their 
fucking balls.

HENRY
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't 
give them the satisfaction.

HENRY watches JIMMY tiptoe up to the AGENTS' car and rap 
on the window. The startled AGENTS look up and see JIMMY 
staring at them.

JIMMY
Come on, fuckoes. Let's go for a 
ride.
(to Henry as Jimmy 
starts his car)
I keep 'em up all fuckin' night.

While HENRY walks to his own car, WE SEE JIMMY roar off 
and we hear the squeal of tires and brakes as JIMMY and 
still sleepy AGENTS in pursuit speed away from the club.

EXT. CAFORA'S PINK CADILLAC PARKED ON BROOKLYN STREET NEAR 
SCHOOL BUS STOP - MORNING

WE SEE SOME YOUNGSTERS walk over to peek in the car. The 
YOUNGSTERS are giggling. ONE BOY sneaks up alongside the 
ear door and peeks inside. We hear a yell.

WE SEE the bodies of FAT LOUIE CAFORA and his wife, DOLORES, 
slumped against each other on the front seat. Blood has 
caked all over their faces from small bullet holes in their 
beads.

EXT. LARGE DUMPSTER BEHIND DINER NEAR AIRPORT - DAWN

screams to helper SO to stop.

EXT.  HOSTS POINT MARKET - TRUCK PARKING LOT - MORNING

WE SEE the open door of a large refrigeration truck. WE 
SEE bright lights and flashbulbs go off.

CAMERA STEADILY MOVES IN ON frozen body hanging from a 
rack inside the truck.

HENRY (V.O.)
Jimmy was cutting every link between 
himself and the robbery, but it 
had nothing to do with me. I gave 
Jimmy the tip and he gave me some 
Christmas money. From then on I 
kept my mouth shut.  I knew Jimmy. 
He had the cash.  It was his. I 
know he kicked some money upstairs 
to Paulie, but that was it.  It 
made him sick to have to turn money 
over to the guys who stole it. 
He'd rather whack them. Anyway, 
what did I care? I wasn't. asking 
for anything and, besides. Jimmy 
was making nice money with me 
through my Pittsburgh connections. 
But still, for months after the 
robbery, they were finding bodies 
all over.

CAMERA MOVES ONTO

CLOSE UP - ANGELO SEPE'S FROZEN FACE

HENRY (V.O.)
When they found Sepe in the meat 
truck, he was frozen so stiff it 
took them two days to thaw him out 
for the autopsy.

INT. SHERWOOD DINER - DAY

A bright sunny afternoon, HENRY and JIMMY seated in a window 
booth.  WE SEE JIMMY eating eggs on pancakes with sausages 
and toasted English muffins.

HENRY (V.O.)
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.  
He was like a kid. We had money 
coming in through my Pittsburgh 
people and after a while even the 
Lufthansa thing began to calm down. 
But the thing that made Jimmy so 
happy that morning was that this 
was the day Tommy was being made.

EXT.  TOMMY DESIMONE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - MORNING

WE SEE TOMMY is all dressed. He kisses his MOTHER. TOMMY 
walks down the stairs toward TWO WISEGUYS and into a waiting 
car.

HENRY (V.O.)
Jimmy was so excited, you'd think 
he was being made. He must have 
made four calls to Tommy's house.  
They had a signal all set up so 
he'd know the minute the ceremony. 
was over.-

INT.  SHERWOOD DINER - DAY

JIMMY has finished his breakfast and spots HENRY's untouched 
melon.

JIMMY
(looking at watch)
You want the melon?

HENRY
Nah.

JIMMY
(reaches for the 
melon and looks at 
his watch)
I better call again.

HENRY (V.O.)
Jimmy and I could never be made, 
because we bad Irish blood. It 
didn't even matter that my mother 
was Sicilian. To become a member 
of a crew, you've got to be one 
hundred percent Italian So that 
they can trace all your relatives 
back to the old country.

INT. ONE-FAMILY BRIOC BUILDING WITH GARAGE UNDER THE FIRST 
FLOOR

WE SEE the car pull into basement garage and door close.

INT. SHERWOOD DINER - HENRY'S POV

From HENRY'S POV in window, WE SEE JIMMY cross the parking 
lot to an outdoor phone booth on the side of the road. 
Trades are roaring past.

HENRY (V.O.)
It's the highest honor they can 
give you. It means you belong to a 
family and a crew. It means that 
nobody can fuck around with you. 
It also means you can fuck around 
with anybody, as long as they aren't 
also a member. It's like a license 
to steal.

INT.  BASEMENT ROOM OFF THE GARAGE

as TOMMY proudly walks into the room, followed by the TWO 
WISEGUYS.

HENRY (V.O.)
As far as Jimmy was concerned, 
with Tommy being made, it was like 
we were all being made. We would 
now have one of our own guys as a 
member.

TOMMY proudly walks into the room. WE SEE a HOOD suddenly 
appear behind him, put a gun to his head and fire. WE SEE 
TOMMY inertly drop to the ground in a heap.

HENRY (V.O.)
Except, they didn't make Tommy 
that day.

CUT TO:

JIMMY - IN PHONE BOOTH

Suddenly, JIMMY slams down the phone with so much strength 
that the booth shudders.

HENRY (V.O.)
They killed him. It was revenge 
for Billy Batts.

When JIMMY turns around, WE SEE that he is crying. WE SEE 
HENRY hurrying toward JIMMY to console him.

HENRY (V.O.)
And there was nothing we could do.  
Batts was a made man and Tommy 
wasn't. We had to sit still and 
take it. It was among the Italians. 
It was real greaseball shit. They 
even shot Tommy in the face so his 
mother couldn't give him an open 
coffin at the funeral.

HENRY (V.O.)
I was going to be busy all day. I 
had to drop off some thirty-eights 
at Jimmy's to match some silencers 
he had gotten. I had to pick up my 
brother at the hospital and drive 
him back to the house for dinner 
and then I had to pick up some new

JIMMY
What fucking good are these things?  
They don't fit. What do I need 
this for? I'm not paying for this 
shit.

HENRY (V.O.)
Right away I knew he didn't want 
them. I knew I was going to get 
stuck for the money. I only bought 
the damn guns because he wanted 
them. And now, he didn't want them.  
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so 
pissed he didn't even say goodbye.

the accident.  I said I was partying 
all night.

CLOSE UP - PILLS IS HENRY'S PALM

kitchen floor.

HENRY (V.O.)
I was cooking dinner that night. I 
had to start braising the beef, 
pork butt and veal shanks for the 
tomato sauce.  It's Michael's 
favorite. I was making ziti with 
the meat gravy, and I'm planning 
to roast some peppers over the 
flames, and I was putting on some 
string beans with the olive oil 
and garlic, and I had some beautiful 
cutlets, cut just right, that I 
was going to fry up before dinner 
just as an appetizer.  I was home 
for about an hour. My plan was 
toStart the dinner early, so Karen 
and I could go unload the guns 
that Jimmy didn't want, and get 
the package for Judy to take to 
Atlanta latex that night. I kept 
looking out the window and the 
helicopter was gone. I asked Michael 
to watch the sauce, and Karen and

See, Karen, didn't I tall him he

KAREN
(barely looking up 
and wandering toward 
kitchen)
I need some coffee.

DEALER puts his arm around HENRY and motions him toward 
the bedroom where they snort some coke and laugh. After 
snorting the coke, HE SEE the DEALER give HENRY a plastic 
package of heroin he has taken out of a paper bag on the 
dresser. HENRY casually puts it in his jacket pocket.

HENRY (V.O.)
My plan was I had to get home and 
get the package ready for Judy to 
take on her trip. Also, I had to 
get to Robin's house to give the 
package a whack with some quinine. 
Plus, I knew Robin was gonna get 
on my ass. Then I had the cooking 
to finish at home, and I had to 
get Judy ready for the trip.

Phone rings in bedroom.

DEALER picks it up, listens a moment and offers it to HENRY.

DEALER

cannot hear in

Robin's place, mix it once and get 
back to the gravy.

near the table.

HENRY snorts some coke, too.

The table and room is a mess. Mixing bowls, scales, and 
sieves are strewn around the room.

For a second I thought I was dead, 
but when I heard all the noise, I 
knew they were cops,  only cops 
talk that way.  If they had been 
wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a 
thing. I would have been dead.

INT.  HENRY'S BEDROOM TOILET - NIGHT

WE SEE KAREN hurriedly flushing heroin down the toilet 
upstairs while we hear FBI MEN at the door downstairs. We 
hear MICHAEL and CHILDREN'S VOICES downstairs.

WE SEE KAREN go to the bureau drawer and grab a small 
caliber gun, lift her dress and, grimacing, shove the cold 
metal into her underpants.

CUT TO:

INT.  FBI OFFICE

HENRY is seated and surrounded by FBI MEN and PROSECUTOR 
EDWARD MCDONALD. WE SEE JUDY WICKS brought in past HENRY 
and ushered into another room. WE SEE the DEALER ushered 
past HENRY and placed into yet another room.

HENRY (V.O.)
All day I thought the guys in the 
helicopter were just local cops 
busting my balls over Lufthansa, 
but they turned out to be Narks. 
They had been on me a month. Phone 
taps. Surveillance.

WE SEE ROBIN brought in, followed by TWO COPS carrying 
cardboard boxes filled with pots, sieves and scales from 
ROBIN's table.  The COPS put the boxes on a-table where 
HENRY can see them.  WE SEE ONE of the NARKS lick his finger 
after wiping it across one of the bowls.  He smiles at 
HENRY and rolls his eyes.

WE SEE HENRY slouch further in his seat while questioning 
continues.

INT.  PRISON VISITING AREA

WE SEE KAREN and HENRY seated at a table in a visiting 
area. HENRY is nervously looking around at the GUARDS and 
whispering to KAREN.

CUT TO:

IN SYNCH

KAREN
(anxious)
Jimmy's calling every day. It's 
urgent.

HENRY
(a little annoyed 
at Karen)
What did he say, exactly?

INT.  HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

KAREN (V.O.)
(her turn to be 
annoyed)
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to 
help. I talk to Mickey every day. 
That's more than I can say for the 
rest.

HENRY (V.O.)
(placating)
Paul will calm down. You'll see.

INT.  JIMMY'S HOUSE - DAY

HE SEE MICKEY on the phone.

KAREN (V.O.)
I told Jimmy the cops took our 
cars and froze our bank accounts 
and he offered to get me some money. 
Be wants to know what's happening. 
You gotta meet him.

HENRY (V.O.)
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I 
tell you I gotta get out of here  
first.  I gotta straighten every-
thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.

CAMERA PANS to sinister JIMMY BURKE in BG.

INT.  PRISON VISITING AREA - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

KAREN
(annoyed and 
indicating the 
jail)
Then you're safer in here.

HENRY
(exasperated)
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. 
They're all afraid I'm gonna rat 
them out. People are already looking 
to walk away from me. I'm dead in 
here. You gotta get me out.

KAREN
(worried)
Who's gonna do that?

HENRY
(pleading)
Just get me out.

CUT TO:

KAREN 

Her face drops, but she's not sure.

EXT.  PRISON BAIL RELEASE GATE - MIDNIGHT

WE SEE HENRY hurry out of the prison. He looks nervous 
over his shoulder.

HENRY (V.O.)
Karen finally got her mother to 
put her house up for my bail. I 
was out.

WE SEE KAREN and her MOTHER are waiting in the car.

HENRY (VO CONTD)
I remember I had this feeling I 
was going to get killed right 
outside the jail.  I knew Paulie        
was still pissed at me and he's 
such a hothead I was afraid he 
might have me whacked before he 
calmed down. And I was also worried 
about Jimmy. Jimmy knew if Paulie 
found out he was in the drug deals 
with me, Paulie would have Jimmy 
killed even before me. This is the 
bad time.  I didn't feel safe until 
I got home.

CUT TO:

INT. HENRY AND KAREN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

ANGEL ON HENRY

frantically looking around the bedroom.

HENRY (V.O.)
So now my plan was to stay alive 
long enough to sell off the dope 
that the cops never found and 
disappear for a while until I got 
things straightened out.

HENRY
(to Karen)
Where's the stuff?

KAREN
What are you talking about?

HENRY
You know. The stuff I left.

KAREN
(beginning to cry)
I flushed it down the toilet.

HENRY
(anguish and anger, 
mixed)
You what?

KAREN
(crying anguish)
What did you want me to do with 
it? They were all over the house.

HENRY
Are you fucking nuts? That was 
forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. 
I was depending on that money.

KAREN
(crying)
They had a warrant. They went 
through everything. They would 
have found it. I swear.

HENRY
Shit You know they would have never 
found it. Why did you do it? Why 
did you do it? My God, why did you 
have to do it?

KAREN
(a primal scream)
Oh no! No!  Noooo!

HEHRY
(screaming)
Why? Why?

WE SEE HENRY, and KAREN holding onto each other as they 
cry and scream, with the screams echoing out on the sound 
track.

DISSOLVE TO:

THEIR FACES

asleep, and CAMERA DOLLIES OUT TO REVEAL a gun in HENRY'S 
hand as they sleep.

INT.  GEFFKEN'S BAR

The place is closed, but inside WE SEE PAUL VARIO in the 
kitchen cooking peppers and eggs in a frying pan with olive 
oil. WE SEE SEVERAL HOODS surrounding him at a distance.  
VARIOUS SUPPLICANTS, a LOCAL BUTCHER, an OLD LADY, etc., 
wait for a papal audience.

VARIO
(looking down)
I warned you a million times.

HENRY
I've been all fucked up since I 
got out.

VARIO
You think I didn't know what you 
were doing?

HENRY
It was easy money. I did it in the 
can.  Shit! I learned the junk 
business in the can, Paulie.

VARIO
Right in my face. You looked in my 
face and you lied.

HENRY
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe 
me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm 
okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm 
clean now. On my children. Believe 
me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting 
for bail got my head together...

VARIO
You thought I was some fucking 
jerk?

HENRY
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I 
didn't want to put you in this 
shit.
(pause)
I was ashamed to come to you. I 
knew I was wrong.

WE SEE VARIO. stand, mute.

HENRY
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need 
help.

VARIO
You treated me like shit.

WE SEE VARIO reach into his pocket and take out a thick 
wad of bills. Without counting the money he puts the cash 
in HENRY'S hands.  VARIO clasps HENRY'S hands in his own.

VARIO
(looking down while 
handing Henry the 
cash)
Here. Take it.
(looking up with 
tears in his eyes)
Now I gotta turn my back on you.

CLOSE UP - HENRY

HENRY (V.O.)
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's 
what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred 
bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't 
have paid for the coffin.

CUT TO:

INT.  HENRY AND KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

KAREN
I'm not going to run. Live the 
rest of our lives like rats. Is 
that what, you want? Leave my 
mother. Leave my family.  Never 
see anybody again.

HOOD
(pleading)
We're gonna leave then anyway, 
because if we stay around here 
we're gonna be dead.

KAREN
(angrily pulling 
away)
They're right. You are paranoid.

EXT. JUKEBOX STOREFRONT - DAY

ANGLE ON JIMMY

Nervously pacing near the doorway.  There are jukeboxes 
and pinball machines of various sizes and hues on the 
sidewalk. Some are being loaded onto panel trucks and carted 
off.

JIMMY
(concerned)
How is he? Okay? Are they busting 
his chops?

KAREN
He's okay. They sobered him up.

JIMMY
Did he say what they're asking him 
about?

KAREN
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so 
much else on my mind.  I got the 
kids.  We got no money.

JIMMY
I gotta talk to him as soon as I 
can.

KAREN
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't 
even know I came here today.  It's 
like he's crazy. Jimmy.

JIMMY
I know. I know. But it'll be okay.  
Don't worry. I got some money for 
you. It's down the block.

WE SEE JIMMY lead KAREN to the edge of the sidewalk and 
point down the block toward a row ot stores.

JIMMY
(pointing)
The third store down.

KAREN (V.O.)
Jimmy just stood there on the 
sidewalk. It felt funny. I started 
walking down the block, but I 
noticed the stores were empty.

CUT TO:

EMPTY STOREFRONT

with chalked storefront

KAREN) (V.O.)
I got a bad feeling.  I just kept 
walking.

CUT TO:

JIMMY standing on sidewalk.

JIMMY
(shouting)
Inside! Go in there!

CUT TO:

EMPTY STOREFRONT

With open door and DARK FIGURES waiting inside.

KAREN
(very rattled)
Jimmy, I'm in a hurry.  I've got 
to pick up the kids at my mother's.  
I'll come back later.

WE SEE KAREN hurry down the block past the stores.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

WE SEE KAREN'S car screech to a halt near the garage as 
HENRY comes racing out of the house toward her. He has a 
gun pressed close to his side.

WE SEE KAREN is frozen to the wheel in fear. She is visibly 
shaking, crying.

WE SEE HENRY very gently pull her from behind the wheel. 
He has cradled her in his arms as, after a wary look around 
the street, HENRY walks her toward the house.

HENRY
What happened? You okay?

KAREN
I got seared.

HENRY
(soothing)
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's 
okay.

KAREN
(still in shock)
I got scared.

INT.  SHERWOOD DINER - LATE MORNING

CAMERA MOVES IN ON TABLE - HENRY'S POV

LONG TRACKING SHOT - THROUGH RESTAURANT

You don't know what you're TRACKING until YOU SEE all the 
food on the table and JIMMY looks up.

HENRY (V.O.)
If you're part of a crew, nobody 
ever tells you that they're going 
to kill you.  It doesn't happen 
that way.  There aren't any 
arguments or curses like in the 
movies. Your murderers come with 
smiles. They come as your friends, 
the people who have cared for you 
all your life, and they always 
come at a time when you are at 
your weakest and most in need of 
their help. So I met Jimmy in a 
crowded place we both knew.  I got 
there fifteen minutes early and I 
saw that Jimmy was already there.  
He took the booth near the window 
so he could see everyone who drove 
up to the restaurant.  He wanted 
to see if I had been tailed.

JIMMY stands to embrace HENRY. WE SEE a table with melon, 
eggs, sausage, toasted English muffins, etc. HENRY notices 
that JIMMY has not touched any of the food. Next to JIMMY, 
WE SEE a large legal folder.

JIMMY
(sailing, friendly 
greeting)
You look good.

HENKF
(shaking his head)
I didn't need the headache.

JIMMY
Come on, eat something.

HENRY
I can't eat,  just get me some 
coffee.

HENRY (V.O.)
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a 
thing. In the old days, Jimmy would 
have ordered doubles and eaten it 
all.  On the surface, of course, 
everything was supposed to be fine. 
We were supposed to be discussing 
my case, just like we always would, 
but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying 
to sense whether I was going to 
rat him out to save my neck.

JIMMY
(patting the legal 
folder)
I think you got a good shot at 
beating the case.

HENRY
How?

JIMMY
It's that rat bastard from 
Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. 
He's been a rat since he got busted 
in Pittsburgh.

HENRY
Yeah.

JIMMY
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, 
in Florida.

HENRY
Yeah.

JIMMY
I want you and Anthony to go down 
there and take care of that bastard. 
Without him, they've got no case.

CLOSE UP - JIMMY'S HAND

giving a piece of paper to HENRY.

TILT UP ON JIMMY AND FREEZE

HENRY (V.O.)
Jimmy had never asked me to whack 
somebody before, but now he's asking 
me to go down to Florida and do a 
hit with Anthony.

CUT TO:

FREEZE OF HENRY HEAD ON

Looking at JIMMY.

HENRY (V.O.)
That's when I knew I would never 
have come back from Florida alive.

UNFREEZE ON HENRY and BACK TO ACTION like nothing is wrong.

CAMERA DOLLIES OUT and WE SEE JIMMY and HENRY sipping their 
coffee. WE SEE JIMMY reach for some food. HENRY passes 
JIMMY the salt.  They are TWO GUYS finishing breakfast in 
a diner.

INT.  FBI OFFICE - DAY

ANGLE ON HENRY AND MCDONALD

arguing. KAREN and SOME FBI AGENTS are standing nearby.

MCDONALD
We'll pack up everything and send 
it to you.

KAREN
I got dry cleaning.

MCDONALD
We'll pick it up.

EXT.  JUKEBOX STOREFRONT - DAY

WE SEE a grim JIMMY getting into the rear seat of an 
unmarked FBI car while HOODS watch silently.

CUT TO:

INT.  FBI OFFICE - DAY

KAREN is now seated next to HENRY on sofa. MCDONALD is 
leaning against the desk. In BG, WE SEE FBI MEN playing 
with the CHILDREN.  HE SEE HENRY and KAREN's suitcases 
stacked near the sofa.

MCDONALD
We'll sell your house here and 
apply the money to your new name.

HENRY
I don't want to go anywhere it's 
cold.

MCDONALD
I can't control that.

HENRY
I don't care who controls it. 
Nowhere cold.

KAREN
He's very bronchial.

INT.  GEFFKEN'S BAR

WE SEE FBI MEN filling the barroom and VARIO, surrounded 
by AGENTS, being handcuffed and shoved toward the door.

CUT TO:

INT.  FBI OFFICE

ANGLE ON HENRY AND MCDONALD

arguing.

KAREN
(whispering to Henry)
What about the schools?

HENRY
Yeah. What about the kids' school?

MCDONALD
Don't worry about the schools. 
We'll take care of the schools.

KAREN
I don't want them left back.

MCDONALD
They won't be left back. They'll 
stay in their grade.

KAREN
That's important.

CUT TO:

INT.  COURTROOM

ANGLE ON BACK OF HENRY'S HEAD

and TRACK AROUND.

HENRY (V.O.)
It was easy for all of us to 
disappear. My house was in my mother-
in-law's name.  My cars were 
registered to my wife. My Social 
Security cards and driver's licenses 
were phonies.  I've never , voted.  
I never paid taxes. My birth 
certificate and my arrest sheet, 
that's all you'd ever have to know 
I was alive.

SLOW DOLLY IS TO HENRY'S FACE.

HENRY (V.O.)
The hardest thing for me was leaving 
the life. I still love the life. 
We were treated like movie stars 
with muscle.  We had it all just 
for the asking.

CLOSE UP - JIMMY BURKE

seated at defense table in grey suit and rimless glasses. 
He almost looks like one of his lawyers.

HENRY (V.O.)
Our wives, mothars, kids, everybody 
rode along. I had paper bags filled 
with jewelry stashed in the kitchen 
and a sugar bowl full of coke next 
to the bed.

IN BG, WE SEE MICKEY BURKE CRYING.

HENRY
Anything I wanted was a phone call 
away. Free cars and the keys to a 
dozen hideouts flats all over the 
city. I'd bet twenty, thirty grand 
over a weekend ...

CLOSE UP - JIMMY BURKE

COME UP ON SCREEN - TWENTY-FIVE YEARS

HENRY (V.O.)
... and than I'd either blow the 
winnings in a week or go to the 
sharks to pay back the bookies.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - PAUL VARIO

looking older and grey. VARIO is looking down.

COME UP ON SCREEN - FOUR YEARS

DOLLY IN TO EXTREME CLOSE UP - HENRY

As be speaks-; in synch, directly to CAMERA. DOLLY IN TO 
EXTREME CLOSE UP as he speaks.

HENRY
It didn't matter. When I was broke 
I just went out and robbed some 
more. We ran everything.  We paid 
off lawyers. We paid off cops. 
Everybody had their hands out. And 
now it's all over.

EXT.  STREET IN MIDWESTERN ANDY HARDY TOWN - DAY

TRACK down the street.

HENRY (V.O.)
And that's the hardest part. Today 
everything is different. There's 
no action.

CAMERA TRACKS past white picket fences.

HENRY (V.O.)
I have to wait around like anyone 
else. Yon can't even get decent 
food. Right after I got hare I 
ordered some spaghetti with marinara 
sauce and I got egg noodles and 
ketchup.

CAMERA APPROACHES house and TRACKS IS TO DOOR OF HOUSE as 
it opens. A MAN, still in his pajamas, leans out to get 
the milk and newspaper.  He looks up. It's HENRY.

HENRY
(Talking to camera)
I'm an average nobody. I get to 
live the rest of my life like a 
schnook.

FADE OUT:



THE END
